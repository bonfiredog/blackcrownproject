<a href="http://blackcrownproject.com">The Black Crown Project</a> has a hearty stew of new content being ladled directly into your chops this week.

I very much hope that you enjoy it, but it does pay to remember that Black Crown is not only centred on the <a href="http://storynexus.com">Storynexus</a> content. When conceiving the project, I wanted to use the infinite savannah of the Internet to spread things out a little. So, whether you are a new piglet or a haunted senior <span style="color: #993300;">\___<span style="color: #000000;">c</span></span>lerk<span style="color: #993300;">____</span><span style="color: #000000;">, do not forget that there are plenty of other things to explore. </span>

Have you read <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Lincolns-Bedsheet-ebook/dp/B00CA88O1W">Lincoln's Bedsheet</a>, a short story depicting Abraham Lincoln as a bed-bound sorceror?

Or <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Mour-ebook/dp/B00CYONSPY/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1376412001&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=mour+mour+mour">Mour, Mour, Mour</a>, the drowned fragments of Jon Praester's last voyage?

Have you seen our <a href="http://blackcrownproject.tumblr.com">Tumblr</a>, or studied the Excavations that you have made in the Marvel Ouse?

&nbsp;

You have? You're full to the brim?

&nbsp;

Oh, that's good.

&nbsp;

Well, here's what you can chug down this week:

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>New Storylets</strong></span>

Dance on the headland, cough up something nostalgic, and take a much-needed bath. There are heaps of new branches on existing storylets, as well.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>New Icons</strong></span>

Despicable and chunk-making, my prose has been matched by <a href="https://twitter.com/misterarendt">Paul Arendt's</a> artwork. He has been wanting to draw the Shushbaby for quite some time.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>New Miasma Objects and Text Shards</strong></span>

Traverse a few more of the Eremite's mistakes, and find the map that brought him to Loss.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Redesigned Tumblr</strong></span>

Our <a href="http://blackcrownproject.tumblr.com">most public of desks </a>has been redesigned; have you found the <a href="http://blackcrownproject.tumblr.com/documents">Documents</a> drawer?

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>A New Landing Page</strong></span>

The sign-in page is now simpler, cleaner and more hopeful for depressed <span style="color: #800000;">\\\\</span>clerks<span style="color: #800000;">////</span>.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Social Acts</strong></span>

You now can begin to tentatively press against your fellow <span style="color: #800000;">\\\\</span>clerks<span style="color: #800000;">////<span style="color: #000000;">; be warned that some may revert to their more animalistic spirits. </span></span>

<span style="color: #800000;"><span style="color: #000000;">You also have the option to invite your Friends; perhaps they can aid you with that particularly stubborn Excavation...</span></span>

<span style="color: #800000;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Miasma Digest</strong></span></span></span>

The Tumblr now contains a Miasma page, with links to all the extant pieces of the Eremite's possessions. If you are not enjoying your Excavations, you can read the Eremite's story <a href="http://blackcrownproject.tumblr.com/miasma">here</a>, instead, without getting any filthier.

<span style="color: #800000;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>My Journey To Eyam</strong></span></span></span>

<span style="color: #800000;"><span style="color: #000000;">The village of Eyam in Derbyshire, where an entire community isolated themselves to halt the spread of the plague, grew out of my head and into the many different trunks of the Institute; I have written and shot <a href="http://bonfiredog.co.uk/bonfog/?p=773">a photo-essay</a> of my time there, for those of you who are interested in where my head goes, sometimes.  </span></span><span style="color: #000000;"> </span>

&nbsp;

I think that is <em>plenty </em>for you to be getting on with. For those of you who have not begun playing, or reading, or feeling a little ill, <a href="http://blackcrownproject.com">can I tempt you</a>?

&nbsp;

You can also follow <a href="https://twitter.com/rob_sherman">me</a>, or <a href="https://twitter.com/BlackCrownProj">the project,</a> on Twitter, for asides, weekly punnics, incoherent strings of consonants, but ABSOLUTELY NO PICTURES OF MY LUNCH, DINNER, BREAKFAST, ELEVENSES OR REFRIGERATED CONCOCTIONS.
