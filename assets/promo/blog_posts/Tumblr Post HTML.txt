Dear readers,

I anticipated announcing myself as the author of the <a title="Give it a weensy poke, go on. It won't split open." href="http://blackcrownproject.com">Black Crown Project</a> on the day of launch, in multiple languages and time-zones, utilising local waifs as scampering whisper-burghers, and letting you all know how much work had gone into it. But, in the event, I sat in my pants, unchecking boxes in the CMS, and feeling a little deflated as the last one emptied. I then got quite drunk and ate some tofu near Leicester Square, which was a small comfort.

But, now the project has been out for a month or so, and we are starting to wring the next words out of the flannel, and I think that I can look back on it with a little pride. The thunderous anxiety is still there, the lock-wristed clumsiness with a new form and experiments in budget and taste, but I feel, when looking over the prose, at the wonderful art that <a title="My mark in terms of Wi-Fi pilfering, if nothing else" href="http://failbettergames.com">Failbetter Games</a> and <a title="Meetings in pubs, dark afternoons, bilious grass" href="http://www.popleaf.com/">Popleaf</a>, and the pure, naughty <em>chance</em> that I have been given to do something peripherally disgusting but internally beautiful, I think what a lucky, lucky boy I am.<!--more-->

The reviews have been, remarkably, mostly positive. I feel pinched off from them like dough, lying on the countertop with worry and insomnia and my loss of appetite, while over there, through the glowing door, and amongst the whirring particles, the rest of the batch rises with appreciation. It is a wonderful sight, but a lonely one too.

And that loneliness is not something that I have ever really experienced, the peculiar one that people say is part of being a writer. I think that I fancied myself as a bit of an ornamental hermit, ready to sit in half-lotus position (I am not very flexible) and tut at the modern world and its need for connection. But, I have learnt, I am just the same; not desperate or weak, just human. This revelation sounds a little dramatic, but I promise you that it really does feel like both a weight lifted and a weight gained. It is hard to be this lonely, but it is good to know that I was being a bit of a twat, by considering myself above such things as company and civilisation, and all its attendant pillowings and boredoms.

So, I thank you for reading <a title="Originally published on the Bonfog" href="http://bonfiredog.co.uk/bonfog">this website</a>, for maybe downloading some of my <a title="I guarantee these writings to be 93% viscera-free" href="http://bonfiredog.co.uk/projects/">poetry, prose, plays or music</a>, and generally being interested in my stilted, "show <em>and</em> tell" way of expressing myself. I have been given an opportunity, here, and I do not intend to waste it.

So, how are you? You will notice that I do not have comments enabled on this website, and there are <a title="I'm grumpy and tender, for two." href="http://bonfiredog.co.uk/bonfog/why-no-comments/">several reasons for that</a>, but don't let it stop you, by any means. I would love to <a title="This is where I receive bug reports, as well, so I will do my best not to send you an email with the word 'weep' repeated 18,000 times. I'll try, very hard." href="mailto:writer@blackcrownproject.com">receive emails</a> telling me what you think; it is a little bit like a miner hearing the ore in the rockface calling out to him in squeaky voices, saying "Yes, yes, come on! It's awful in here! Dig us out, you handsome, gainfully-employed human!"

If you are reading this on the <a title="More Works" href="http://blackcrownproject.tumblr.com">Tumblr</a>, repost to your heart's content. There is flipping <em>fan art</em> on there now. I am bowled over.

Anyhoodles, that is all for now. I apologise that the blog, and thus any voice other than Black Crown, has been quiet for so long. Sitting here at about 9am now, I have not even had a cup of tea, which means that I can, at least, still write 500 words without needing to get up and fuss about.

I think that is what they call "the flow". And I will be stopping it, right now, because I am bloody thirsty.

Lots of real, strident love,

Rob Sherman

PS There is some new content going live this week. I apologise, if you are those wonderful people on the forum who are <em>devouring</em> everything in sight, that it may not last long. But there is a new document from the Widsith Institute, as well, and some other goodies which should make you, if not happy, disturbed in a familiar fashion.

PPS I realise that I do not have a really good author's photo. As you may have realised from their proliferation on dust jackets, press releases, and blowings-up to grainy magnificence above panels at conventions, these are important; they are a synaesthetic portrait, words and ideas and passions rendered as (usually) excellent bone structure and soft, understanding eyes. The best I could muster is a picture taken in a pub six years ago, in a holey jumper where, five minutes after the picture was taken, a friend had to be carried out, insensible, by an honour guard of friends like a priest-queen.

I need something better.

The below have been taken as a portfolio for anybody who needs a picture of me, because the one taken at the press day captured me at my most molten and exhausted.

Some have been taken outside in the midst of NATURE, fulfilling the ancient prerogative of author photographs, and I am wearing a pea coat, which must earn me some points in Writer Top Trumps. I have tried to show my range as best as possible. Enjoy.

These photos were all taken by <a href="http://sarahalice.tumblr.com" title="Buy her stuff! Coming soon!">Sarah Alice</a>.

This shows me relieving myself up against a sweet chestnut.

This shows me clowning between two trunks, perhaps trapped by circumstance? No, trunks.

The two previous photographs do not show me without any trousers on. They are unfortunately sepia-tinged.

This one has it all - the pea coat, the stormy sky, the Austenesque hero thinking about the pub about a mile to the left.
