            <Synopsis>A public service order by the Loss Town Hall. </Synopsis>
            <Text>(Atop this official document is the same symbol that is found on top of the feasibility report, as well as large, red warning that reads: “DANGER! KEEP OUT OF REACH OF CHILDREN!”)

The Loss Town Incineration Bureau
Dated That Day That Shall Come
Parents, Pollution And You: Infant Destruction Order No. 17

	This is a PUBLIC DISPLAY ORDER relating to Civil Justice Order !?K93: INFANT DESTRUCTION AND DISPOSAL. Articles below, if applicable, are to be complied with at a date no later than MIDNIGHT ON THAT DAY THAT SHALL COME. Any failure to do so could result in judicial action or forcible removal of your offspring. 

ARTICLE 1 – SYMPTOMS OF INFECTION

	The infection appears first in the form of black rings around the forehead of the child; the child will not complain of discomfort, though the bands will look like patterned bruising; if the pattern resembles bird-flight or crossed blades seek professional advice immediately. The doctor's banishment has temporarily been lifted in light of the current emergency, and she may be booked for appointment at the Town Hall. The child may complain of visions on the theme of hiding, secrecy or the clandestine; deal with such complaints in a soothing, non-confrontational manner. The child must not be allowed to realise their plight, or become alarmed; this can elevate the spread of infection and cause the child distress. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD THE CHILD BE CAUSED DISTRESS. The Loss Town Incineration Bureau have released a range of confectionery designed to lower stress and suspicion in infants; they are available at Sinister And Dexter's for a nominal price. 

ARTICLE 2 – CONTINUATION OF SYMPTOMS

	Around two weeks after the illness is first detectable the bruising around the forehead will begin to disappear. The child will become withdrawn and feverish; contusions on the hands and pads of the fingers will appear, akin to blisters or sores. The child may also begin to sweat alarmingly, and also tremble when holding small tools or cutlery. The arms will begin to stiffen and your son or daughter will have difficulty rising. These symptoms are known to vary depending on the child and their temperament. Typically the child will begin nesting around this time, using: 

- blankets 
- cushions 
- binding agents such as glue or honey 
- their own bodily products such as mucus, nails and hair. 

A failure to nest does not preclude that convalescence has been a success. The proto-dwelling is usually first found in the back garden, toilet or mushroom cellar; the common characteristics of location appears to be low temperature and high humidity. It must not be destroyed or removed, as this could cause the child distress. The child may also begin to produce meaningless strings of nonsense-phrases, rendered either in ink, mud, food products or glyphs constructed from small stolen household objects. Early reports suggest that these phrases revolve around themes of breath, fire and the grave. In children below the normal age of literacy, it must be stressed that this is NOT A SIGNAL OF INTELLECTUAL ADVANCEMENT. Phase One of your Grief Procession should also have begun at this point. The surreptitious burning of the child's possessions and bedding must be initiated; three items a day is the recommended rate. Any more and the child will become suspicious. THIS IS TO BE AVOIDED.

ARTICLE 3 – THE DESCENT TO DEATH

	The child will begin to extend their nesting radius, spending more time in its construction and maintenance; nests of over two storeys have been reported, and parents should not be overly alarmed. The child will begin to have trouble breathing; any use of oxygen masks is prohibited, as this serves only to prolong the child's suffering. By the third week of infection all of the child's possessions should be completely destroyed, though they will not be missed, as the child will begin to spend all their time in the vicinity of their nest. Breathing equipment purchased from the Town Hall should enter utilisation at this point for the rest of the family unit; the fumes that the child begins to exude are dangerous to adult respiration. Please be advised that equipment purchased elsewhere may be defective and could lead to soaring visions or paralysis. Under no circumstances should you embrace, or have any physical contact with, your child. 
	 Death occurs approximately two weeks after the point of maximum nest height, measured by the height of the child multiplied by the number of grandparents still living. Phase Three of Grief Procession (see separate Public Order Sheet) is to be initiated. Weeping and the tearing of clothes are encouraged, though prohibited in public. 

ARTICLE 4 – RITUALS AND PROCESSES RELATED TO YOUR DEAD CHILD

	The child body must be burned; it is advised that you lock the corpse in your cellar, outhouse or similarly isolated space for the following reasons: 

1) In order to allow the rest of your family normal respiration without masks for some time. 
2) To desiccate the cadaver for ease of ignition. 
3) To allow you to come to terms with your bereavement. 

Before necrosis sets in, however, the body must be prepared for cremation. The rituals must be performed in this order;

- Ritual Relating To The Release Of Starlings And The Lower Soul
- The Spreading Of Bleach And The Placing Of Fungus In The Eyes
- The Murder Of Siblings and Grandparents

	Depending on the size of your oven, and the number of bodies generated by the final ritual, one may be tempted to burn the bodies in one's home kiln. THIS IS PROHIBITED UNDER ALL CIRCUMSTANCES. The spread of foul air must be contained to the town square, and all bodies must be delivered at 9.30am, 12.30pm or 3pm (the Town Hall will provide carts and beasts for the transport of bodies). It is imperative that your respiratory masks are worn at all times. A final goodbye will be permitted within the designated Farewell Zonings, and then the body will be removed for final absolution. Within three days you will be notified of your scheduled visit from demolition crews to remove the child's bedroom from your home. 

	Thank you for your attention and vigilance. Please read the above instructions carefully and prepare for the worst. The Mayor wishes to congratulate you all in advance for your protection of the town and its livelihood, and has stated that at the first sign of infection he will begin the ritual murder of his own children. 

Yours sincerely, 


(An odd signature, like a gnostic, ritualistic diagram).

            <Synopsis>A diary entry relating to an exploration of the town. </Synopsis>
            <Text>May 20th

(Just above this date are various runic calculations, eldritch marks and counts of the passage of time, as if the Eremite is having trouble keeping track of the date).

	You see, here, what the so-called “authorities” have sent as comfort to those families afflicted; so cold, so hurtful! There is barely anyone in the streets. I only see Friend dull-eyed, wandering from the work of her father to the bare shopfronts, and from there back up to her eyrie in Building 4. We speak rarely, now. Her father is busy burying those who wish to be buried. The ash is a boring, constant snow. The townspeople seem to have an aversion to being interred, and only a few in every generation do so. The pyres have slipped into the streets, the church's eaves, the square, and onto the river in long lines of pontoons that blunder peacefully, like great smoking palanquins holding vacationing royalty, downstream. I still do not know where they all go; perhaps all the way to the sea. There seems to be no scriptural aspect to any of these proceedings, only personal opinion and taste. The dead are the dead. 
	I attended the funeral of Spider's Nest in Barn, yesterday; he had been ill for weeks, though not with the plague. I never knew how old he was, and no-one would tell me, though his sexual inexperience and penchant for inventive swearing gave him the air of a much younger man. He had spoken to me a few days before he died, not bedridden but sat at his desk whistling through his teeth and scooping earwax out of himself with a specialised widget, that he was glad he had lived to see the death of his people. I told him that it was not the death of all of them, that only a few children had succumbed, and he had nodded his head grimly. The old bat's funeral was short, as Mr. Lights had to continue his duties. The Long Men Tails placed on his grave, traditionally by the women of the town, were quickly removed and held grimly by the council-appointed mourners for the next funeral, the attendees of which stood sweating in their heavy robes. They then demolished the library. The Mayor merely watched for some time, before smiling and commenting on the excellent and invigorating sunshine they had been experiencing. After this outburst he had crawled, a defeated monoped, back into his halls. 
	Three days ago I had maintained my post in my apartment for nearly a week solid; I was becoming ornamental, calcified, terrified to leave the room. The people were of a weird disposition, even more so than usual, and what had begun as a fascination with their idiosyncrasies became like looking into a very deep ocean trench, where light does not reach and fish hurriedly grow as many eyes and mouth and fins as possible, and eat each other in a horridly rapid fashion as if the film that they are projected from had been sped up. There is a strangeness and a brutality in their day-to-day business, the burning of their children, the murder of their elderly, their keening as if to some Stygian god, though the gods are the last thing that they would keen for. They scream to themselves, and having seen the wailing for the Gentiles at Jerusalem, the cutting of labia for Ouroboros in Chad and the pissing on trees and scattering of seeds in Canada. A people with no religion, with no-one to turn to, is a terrifying thing indeed. I had not removed my mask in that time at all; the advent of the disease had made me cautious, and the recycled air and carbon were starting to drip and solidify into stalactites at the end of my trunk.
	On that day, ready to bond with the floor and become some sort of mineral, I heard a knock at my door. I bounded to it, expecting it to be Friend come to apologise for her indiscretion, or someone bringing food. However, I was neither wrong nor correct. It was a tall, shapely girl of twenty years or so with a crop of white hair that ranked around her face like the battle helmet of some albino Irishman. I held the door to a crack, and she waited expectantly for a greeting. I eventually placed her; the hurried footsteps across the hot square in the March heat, the spluttered title of “Long Man”, the birthday that had been celebrated in her absence a month before, her age a supposedly ridiculous number. Dark words directed up into the woods after her. She was the town witchdoctor, a beast-shaman who lived high in the trees and spoke to the spiders and deer, who spoke to Whisper in a great holler in the midst of night, one whom no-one looked at directly, or spoke of without ending the conversation. She was treated with special dismissal even in this patriarchy where the women were seen as explosive castratos, problem-men who only existed to eject milk in gleaming fountains.
	She wore a formal yet summery dress of blue, covered in small flowers, and, seeing my recognition, gave me a strange curtsy, one that involved lifting her dress almost over her head, revealing the whale-white scars and infected tattoos high up on her legs. I remember, then that she spoke to me in the tone of a stern father, and asked how I was. My reply was inconsequential; before I could finish she produced from behind her back a tin of chicken paste, with the local seal of wax. She handed it to me, and in my excitement and hunger I cut my fingers on its edges. I forgot that I was wearing my mask, and began to push the mess through the filter in my haste. I asked her to leave while I ate, and when she refused I was too hungry to argue. Off it came, and the second woman in ten years saw the colour of my eyes. 
	When I had finished, she asked me, slowly and quietly, if I would come with her. I had come to a reckoning with the walls and floor of my abode, a reckoning of comfort, and I was scared to leave the building. However, she repeated her request, and it became, quite suddenly, the most reasonable and basic request that had ever been asked of me. I gathered my camera and recording box, tying my pack shin-ways to keep it tight, and followed her brisk pace down the stairs to the dark canals below.  
	I remember little of the journey to her hut; night was welling up from the valley floor, and there were fires everywhere and the tang of barbecue. Humped, crying shapes were pushing other shapes into the canals, and as we reached the Main Street long lines of people roamed it, peering into shops, coughing and nervous. No-one looked at her, or me. Perhaps it was that without my mask I was merely another rube, another Mongoloid ferreting through the black store-rooms and alleyways. I remember dark shapes that seemed to me to be the bobbing heads of some demon were the nests of children, filled with their own faecal scratchings and the agony of their illness. They hang in the trees like the dreaming heads of gibbons, and shivered as their occupants turned in their last night’s sleep. The day before I had recorded the cries of spectators as one boy, delirious and bleating, had fallen from his nest, shattering on the pavement before his parents. There are more machines, down by the river, but now I do not even bother to search for them.
	We left the Old Town behind, and the confectioners, and past the beetroot fields that were past season and wilting and black, full of vegetable liquid and sluice from the river. Her home, I surmised, was set far away from the town, and indeed I had seen many workers thumb some sigil in the direction of these hills. I asked her if she believed she had any magic powers. She said that she did not. I asked her her name. She told me, simply, turning and illuminated by the pyres in the distance, that her name was Cunt. I was taken aback by such a creature uttering such a phrase, and asked her who had given her this name. She frowned and told me simply that her mother had, and this was enough, and she turned back and walked further into the woods. 
	We came, after half an hour or so of hard hiking, to a barrier of sorts. We were in the midst of an ironwood forest, that rose onto the side of the mountain. I realised that we were heading north, towards that wrong-footed mountain where the Mayor thought the sun rose. On the ground was a silvery line, wet like a slug's trail, that extended in a large curve on both sides into the woods. I asked her what it was, and she told me that it was as far as the townspeople could come. It was human spittle, forming a neat band. The people came all the way out her to curse at the borders of her home. They called her the foulest word my adopted tongue could muster. They hated her. I watched her skip over it like a rope.
	The path continued for another five minutes or so, winding up to an utterly hermetic position in a crag of basalt amongst the crowns of sturdy evergreens rotting into death and mist. Her hut was here, unremarkable; raised on stilts like those of the farmers, thatched and circular, with five storeys. She led me inside. 
	I had expected more, if I am honest. It was a farmer's hut. There was not one Long Men Tail; she said that she had no use for them. She brewed beet tea in an urn, and I saw the smoke meander to the upper floors through a hole in the ceiling. She took off her shoes and I saw her feet were hard and gnarled like those of Victorian furniture. For such an animal to end in these extremities shocked me. She said that she walked a lot. 
	And then we spoke. We did little more, for a long time. She showed me her wand, the only Long Man Tails in the house hanging from it, given to her by the Town Hall or divine providence, she would not specify; I realised that I had seen her on the day of the Inauguration, in a shawl and carrying the great metallic albatross like it was truly precious, sitting behind the Mayor, not speaking, not watched. She told me that on certain ritual evenings she had to sleep with the Mayor; she knew that he did not enjoy it, and that he would force a smile for the crowds waiting beneath his window. She merely grinned, and said that he liked her more than he would admit. I set up my recording equipment, after a time, to preserve it. She was brutally frank. I asked to take her photograph, and she agreed, providing that I concealed her face on the negative. I promised her I would do this. I was compelled to keep such a small promise. She was different from any woman I had met.  
	After an hour or so, she suddenly rose and asked me to leave. She seemed to be listening for something, or someone, out inside the night. She walked me back down the mountain to where the townspeople came no further, and bade me goodbye. I saw her phantasmal head bobbing like a Nippon lantern back through the trees, but I turned and hurried back through the town, the sounds of wailing low like Fokkerwulfs jettisoning their burning brains over my house, the fires smouldering, ready to be rekindled in the morning. I went straight to sleep, and spent the next day reading.
	I have heard people say that the Mayor is sick, though no-one will dare enter this quarters to check him for the black soot. Friend cannot possibly mourn the loss of her step-father; she always told me that she hated him, that he made her father spiteful. We had both especially hated his son. A few days ago I sat by my windows watching amantinas of ash drift away up the valley, when a small belch of flame licked itself and vanished into the clean airlock of the atmosphere. The sparks had hit a tyre of fat curling and heaving itself into the sky, and I knew then that I had seen the last flight of that hateful little pig. I wish she had been with me so that we could have both laughed behind our hands, as I had taught her; I pitied the Mayor, but after it all, I did not mourn the boy. Perhaps it would not have been wise, perhaps the shit had been her cousin, or her half-brother; the ethnic nepotism that these people practice means that I can never tell who is related to whom. 
	I have already begun planning my exit from the valley; I made careful note of the route that the rube from the woods brought me when I came here, and I have streamlined my pack so that I may run, if necessary. The town was hostile to me from the beginning, and though I have learnt much since coming here, this illness has shut the place up like a bivalve. There is nothing left. I will speak to Friend tomorrow about coming with me; I can take her to Minerva’s; they can give her books, wash her, soothe her, bring her into the day slowly. Sigurd will bring her papers. They will look after her, and I can have her tell me more, to fill in the gaps of this place. She has often spoken about leaving. And I should like to see her legs in a real dress, running over concrete instead of dirt. 
	I can hear the town cryer. He is howling. 

May 21st

	The town seems quiet today – there are no fires, and the few people I have seen have greeted me cautiously as they pluck provisions from the supermarket; there is a huge pile of coins on the empty counter, embellished with reverence by every potential looter. This strikes me as pathetic, though I believe that I am just tired. I saw two men pull a huge, grey hose from the side of a cylindrical structure and course steaming water over the cobbles of the main square. I could smell vinegar, over everything. One man carried all of the nude photographs in a haversack. I have replaced my mask out of habit - the skin on my face is foetus-fragile.
	I went down the River Walk to try and escape the grain in the air. It is an old street, bordered by high, dry-stone walls and climbing ivy, snow-blossom and petunias, peppered with gateways leading to mansions and the observatories of the rich. Before I reached the river I found a fresco, peppered with mould, painted onto one of the walls – it showed a fearsome man holding some sort of spear, wearing a crown (though it is not black) and standing astride a mountain. The accompanying legend was written in the Tachygraph, and I attempted to translate it; it seems I would have no more teaching, now. 
	My attempt is below. 

As I tread through snow
The holes my feet make behind me
Look like the nostrils of my enemies
Upturned and skywards
Their heads rolling in the fields.

General Points


Writing is OVER-EGGED – pare back the invention, and the language, in the more official documents. Image fatigue could be a problem – OK for Eremite and bestiary etc., but changes in style are important. 

Go through and underline key points by the 

Descriptions of beasts and format in the Bestiary

Arthur gets his own section.

More footnotes, side-notes, explanations, contradictions.

Make references to the writing on his eyeholes. 

More diagrams

More incidental detail, and events - not just him walking around. 

More description of the orchestra - a breakdown of it all!

More metal 

More about dates, the use of dates. 

More about the progress of the disease

Add links to references in the book - Loss

More about decay - a progress

integrate the names of kickstarter donaters into widsith staff list

Idea - The suitcase novel needs to use "I" and others.

The breakdown of infrastructure

The return of life to the streets.

Back to the Loss Hotel  -a mini survival game

Mention the school elsewhere?

More diary entries towards the end - charting her demise

trees and plants - research

Do they go on a trip?

Folk story - on the CD?

Make this more habitual – exploring strange towns is his job. 

More for each date, more granularity and breakdown of condition, linked to everything else. 

All dates coupled with his workings out of what date it actually is

More about machinery

The gods are inside us - that is the disease.

            <Text>Photograph of the Band

In the journal the reader will find a photograph of four men sitting on a bandstand. It is hung with streamers and cornucopia, and woodland can be seen behind its planks. Their expressions are either impassive or hostile. They wear the strange lightning strips in bands around their heads, like crowns. They are clad in waistcoats covered in swirling patterns, and grandiose cravats. One holds a mandolin, another a harp, and another a strange, extravangant trumpet. The legend reads:  

	The section heads of the town orchestra, Feburary 9th. 
	After playing one of their pieces for me, I had them sit; in hindsight I realise that their frowns and propensity to fidget were at my placing of the Long Men Tails on their heads; in any other part of the world the implication would be quite insulting. The man at bottom right, Withering Skin And Dog Rug, could not be pictured with his instrument; it was a curious construction. I have attempted to draw it below, though it is difficult to do so, it really must be witnessed, though as soon as the song was over a great tarpaulin was thrown over it. 
	He had opened a hatch on its side, attaching a long tube to a fastening at his chest as he did so, and climbed into its construction. The thing is possibly ten feet high, and the sound it produces is like a mass of tubas de-tuning suddenly, or the sigh of a whale. I did not note the name of the instrument itself.   

(Here is an amateurish sketch of tall cabinet, set on carved leonine legs, with a small human figure for scale. It is covered in pipes and bellows, and long tubes protrude from its top. A ladder runs up to a door set with glass on its side.) </Text>

            <Synopsis>The coat of arms of the town of Loss, with accompanying explanation.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Feburary 29th

Opposite is a composite drawing that I completed over several days in my room and on the street; the town's crest seems to always be in the most distant or troublesome spot. Much was guesswork, though I believe that I received the elements correctly; the black crown I cannot guess at, though the key is a real object, kept by the Mayor, a symbolic fetish that I was given to hold on my first day here. The turkey dragon is a disgusting yet beloved creature native to these parts, and the beetroot something of a national crop, if Loss can be considered a nation; it certainly has no betters or rulers other than itself. The ball at lower right refers to a piece of equipment from K!K!K! (see my later notes) and in the centre is a banjo or zither-type instrument, though its shape is suggestive and seems to draw giggles from the children who play catch in the fountain where one such crest is located. The colours are so vibrant and omnipresent, brought out in tempera and shellac, that I attempted to replicate them myself, though I must apologise about their quality; the only medium I had were colouring pencils from the school. 

Next to this description is a large, torn sheet of paper, upon which are scrawled innumerable sketches, plans and perspectives of a heraldic motif that is copied larger and more neatly in the centre, and coloured with thick crayon. In its centre is a gold-edged shield, and above this a tall mountain fringed by brilliant sunlight. Out from this in both directions, and leading down to border the shield, are thick fronds of beetroot, Long Men Tails, and finally a motto in the Tachygraph, the alphabet of Loss. Around this are various notes in tones of frustration, one of which states, “And still a mystery as to what this says! Reverse translation often depends on context; unfortunately, I have none.” The shield is divided into four quadrants and a long middle section. The top-left quadrant shows an ornate, golden key. The bottom-left quadrant shows a black crown. The top-right quadrant shows a strange, obese beast with stubbed wings, a long snout and broken tusks, and the bottom-right quadrant shows a misted globe, fringed with bronze filigree and with a ticker-tape of script extending from an aperture in its base. The central section depicts a stringed instrument, the body of which is shaped like the head of a phallus, and from the base of which a single, perfect droplet of white liquid falls. </Text>

            <Text>A Note For Sam

At the end of the journal, the reader will notice a bulge in the lining of the back cover. Opening it, he will find a letter addressed to:

Clerk North
//::For Eyes Unfurrowed//:: 

Opening the letter, the reader will find a typed sheet, much in the style of the introductory letter found in the suitcase, with the Widsith’s logo at its head, and its motto at the base, printed on the same paper. 

Clerk!
Be Diligent!
Be Sure That All Has Been Examined, Overturned. 
THIS IS VITAL!

Five pages of blank paper follow, and, at the very bottom of the sixth page:

Slit the lining of the case, Mr. North.

            <Text>Photograph of K!K!K! Players

In the journal the reader will find a photograph of two men standing with hands clasped before them. One is thin and pale, the other swarthy, with thick arms. They both wear the same outfit: a white tank-top, braces, and green breeches. On the pale man’s chest are the words “I Am Love For All Gods” and on the swarthy man’s chest are the words “I Am Discovering Leprosy”. They have writing on their faces, and distinct lines painted there, but they are illegible. The legend reads:

            <Text>Aftermath Speech

In the envelope, the reader will find a compact disc. It is in a transparent sleeve and carries no markings; its face is a blank white. Upon listening, there is only one track. The track contains two distinct voices; both are distorted, mechanical, and stilted, as if they speak the words without understanding their meaning. After a short musical a chime, the first voice heard is that of a woman. She says:

THE WIDSITH INSTITUTE SERIES.
Number:://984752039480QW - The Denouement. 
Authorised by level 16 Reference::// 49832095803 designation K.A.F.K.A
For the imperious attention of under-clerk reference 000781: designation, Samuel North. 
If you are not the clerk in question, please burn this disc and undertake Lifestyle Changes To Forget Its Existence. 
If you are the clerk in question, listen carefully to the following message. Please insure that you are alone, as the contents of this message are not for unkeen ears. 
The message begins.

The next voice that is heard is that of a young man, bright in tone, and cheerful. 

Good afternoon, evening, sun-rise, prayer-time or equinox, Sam. 

Firstly, an official note, I am afraid. Please make sure that you have fully dissected the Eremite’s belongings, and have your report ready to submit in full. Its format is not important. The recording will continue in twelve seconds. 

(12 seconds pass).

Thank you, Sam, and thank you for your assistance. I hope that now your understanding of the Eremite’s unique situation is complete. When I petitioned your approval, I trusted my own judgement implicitly. I knew that we would require a candidate who would be proficient at separating fact from lie, or embellishment, or evasion. I will be honest with you, my superiors were not as faithful in your skills as I was. But it is a credit to this organisation that they acquiesced. 

For this clerk, it is, in a way, a futile exercise you have undertaken. No matter our hypotheses, we will never know the truth of it. We will never be able to speak with Loss, as it was. We will never see the fires that he saw. All is burnt. This is something that you will come to accept in this profession. Though I am only a junior clerk, I have locked too many drawers, in my time. 

And, as I explained, the Eremite, too is gone. He maintained to the end that Ayer’s was hollow. He is petrified there, now. No hiker or indigenous is allowed within six miles of the site. 

I am sure that by now you are weary of my constant platitudes, but I am a great admirer of yours. I would like you to know that I submitted my entire collection of your works for the Candidate Efficacy Process, and will not recieve them back. This is no false adoration, and your writings have provided me with many hours of solace in the blacker stretches of my life. 

I tell you this so that you believe my regret of the following.

In the compartment of the case where you have found this recording, there is also a sheet of writing, and a small drift-way pointing to an island in the centre of the Pacific Ocean. This is Mu. You would be right in believing that it is not there. 

We have misdirected you slightly for your own comfort, and for this I am utterly apologetic. The Eremite worked for us; he was one of our operatives, albeit a maverick element that we found difficult to control. His actions are in no way a reflection of the values or mission of the Widsith Institute. 

We do not welcome his death, but his mistakes have cost us a great deal. Only by his ineptitude could he have destroyed such a place by accident. His talent was in finding things none other could find. Once such wonders were uncovered, however, he was not known for his gentle touch. 

The girls were a problem. They always had been. We have euthanised many rheum-eyed valley girls that he brought back with him. He believed that this one would have been no different. Minerva’s would not have taken her. I met the man only once. A short, proud thing. But, he had the requisite skills. The talents. The genetics.

Genetics are very important to us, Sam. We pride ourselves on being equipped with the best facilities science affords. We make significant discoveries every day. I am sure that you will agree that an organisation as singular as our own has a duty, a responsibility, to gather employees on the basis of their biology. No mistakes can be made. They cannot be afforded. 

You and the Eremite share a very singular genetic defect. It is one that noticed emerging from the late Middle Ages onwards, a corruption of your DNA that renders you quite immune to one, specific disease. Only eighty people in the world have ever caught it, until, of course, the Eremite removed his mask. 

The mask was not protection for himself against some mountain contagion. It was our insurance against failure. He was a carrier for this very specific illness, and, as long as he did not expose his nose or mouth to anyone, there was no risk of contagion. But the mask did come off. I am sure that you have gathered that from your readings. He was not a bad man. But he was a short, proud thing. And given to flamboyance. Were it not for his skills we would not have employed him. 

And so, finally, we come to you. Your genealogy, medical history and lineal health all suggested as much, and, if you are reading this now, our hopes are most likely fulfilled. Your resistance is similar. 

If you have performed your task correctly, and opened every item in the case, I would like to deliver your promotion. Welcome to the Widsith Hive Envoy Initiative. Your forebears were warriors, shamans, priestesses and artists. You should take a few moments to congratulate yourself. 

If you broke the seal on the Evidence Containment Sac enclosing the Eremite’s gas mask, please allow me to list the idiosyncrasies of the contagion with which you are now infected. Please, do not leave the room, or panic. 

If you disobeyed our orders, and allowed another to be present when you opened the case, that person is now infected also, and unless they are one of a fraction of the world’s population with a similar resistance, they will be dead within two months. Please take this chance to admonish, console, or otherwise commune with the intruder.

The disease is passed through respiration, and so the gas mask is the only method for containing and filtering it. You may, for the moment, use the Eremite’s mask, though we will in time provide you with your own, attuned to your sensibilities. The Eremite’s was modelled after a cloud he saw on the night he lost his virginity. You may yourself have sentimental allusions you wish to preserve. 

The chance remains that you did not open the Evidence Containment Sac before listening to this message. This is a necessary risk of the recruitment process. If you feel outrage, horror, or betrayal, I must advise you that it is useless to attempt to seek legal redress. As I have already noted, we are not listed publicly, and, without resorting to unsavoury detail, such action would not end satisfactorily for you. Any use of the suitcase as evidence in court will only be met with ridicule, and will likely infect members of the jury and audience. This is another risk we are willing to adopt. Such is our belief in you as a candidate.

Once such rebellious emotions have passed, please continue with the tape. 

(Ten seconds pass). 

If you are ready to continue then I must advise you not to leave the room at this moment, or come into contact with another human being; this would be a risj to your health and to that of others. Once you have finished listening to and digesting this recording, you should begin wearing the gas mask and adjusted your breathing to its peculiarities.

May I say again how pleased I am that my recommendation has been approved, and that soon we will be colleagues. I look forward to meeting you in person. 

Please now take the following into account:

1) The frontispiece contained within the envelope is for your own journal; we have left a space for you to insert some nomenclature for yourself. Feel free to take inspiration from your forebears.
2) A journal will be made available to you at a later date.
3) The map is the most complete image we have of your first assignment. 

You will be travelling to Mu on our behalf. You will be fully compensated and covered for your travel and experiences, and in return all we ask is that you observe and record all that you see, in your own inimitable style. You will be fully trained in diving, submersible operation, ocean magic and all other skills required for this excursion. 

When you are next contacted you will be directed to Southern California. In Los Angeles is an agent of ours known as Jormun Grimsdottir. He is currently the manager of Myrging Shipping, and will give you your next instructions. You are free to take the Eremite’s belongings with you, though if you choose not to do so please destroy and dispose of them after you have sent us your report. Excuses and misdirection are already being implemented for your family, friends and professional liaisons, and due to risk of infection it is best that you do not attempt to contact them. 

This is the end of our current correspondence. The next time we speak will be in person. I am, once more, mortified that I have had to decieve, as is everyone here at the Institute. Such deception is elaborate, but has proven necessary. Your co-operation is expected, but human natureis fickle, and we must guarantee our return. As a student of human nature, we believe you will understand. 

Once you task is completed I will personally put in a formal request for an antidote to be administered. 

Thank you again, Sam. You would make the world proud, if she could know. 

Safe Travels in Mu, 

Director Level 12:// 823RG Designation: T.W.A.I.N.

There is a click, and the voice of the woman begins to speak after a short musical chime. She says:

The message ends.
Please destroy the disc, or erase its contents. 
Ensure your new mask is fitted correctly. 
Leave the building in the safest and quietest manner possible. 
Welcome, Envoy.

In the journal the reader will find a photograph of Death of a Friend. The look on her face is difficult, clouded but not entirely unpleasant. She is evidently unimpressed by something, and seems flustered, perhaps caught at a bad time. In her hands she clasps the heart that the Eremite gave her as gift, nestled in its wrapping. The legend beneath reads:

            <Text>Photograph of Death of a Friend with Key

In the journal the reader will find a grubby, hastily developed print, covered in thumbprints, errant dirt, and cooking grease. Against the background of a unwashed stovetop, covered with the remnants of survivalist meals, stands Death of a Friend. She is a slip of what she once was. Her face is gaunt, cheeks pinched, and her narrow arms are covered in scraped, scabbed writing. Her hands and limbs are filthy, and the dress hangs from one shoulder. In one hand she clutches a delicate flower, thorns embedded in her thumb, and in the other clutches, with difficulty, the weighty, ceremonial key of the town. The legend reads:

“The Last Mayoress, Ready For Her Journey, July 3rd”

            <Text>Feburary 2nd

	My left toe felt as if it was nearly severed at the root; my boots were nothing more than Greek wrappings, and I had used all of my balm yoghurt to colour the heat in my joints. My pack was heavy, my memorabilia falling to dust occassionally when I had not affixed them well enough. I had to leave Eligius' Throat next to the den of some warrening beast, to let it roll with forest lice and spiders, poisoning them forever now that it was free from its lead sheath. Jenny's pendant, also, gave me bad dreams in the hammock. They had both had their use. 
	The rock rose around me, filled with a marvellous Cretaceous sparkle; I had seen rock like that all over the world, but it was beautiful nonetheless. I had not worn my mask in days, having met no-one on the road, but the maps told me that the entrance to the valley was near, though I found no tracks, no depressions of carts or cattle, nor any shrine or signpost that would reveal my location. I was nervous of acquainting with others; I had only the furrowed recordings of my own voice and those of the hallooing sailors to keep me company, and even then I thought that the water had got to them, and the voices were warping worse; now they are gone completely, as if I had never taken that voyage.
	Looking at my maps it appears that I turned into a wide caldera burrowed into the mountains, filled with wildgrass and trees; the map shows tiny conifers that I have drawn, though they could have been of any order; I remember only their shade and the small lagoon dropped amongst them, the water springing from the surrounding rock as if Moses had passed. I lapped at the pool on my knees; the sea air had rubbed my hands and throat raw. I believe that I seated myself, unslung my Tarot harp and began to play. It was completely tuneless, though I managed to wrestle a short arpeggio from it, one that ended in a flourish that, I hoped, would stave off rain and make the sticky day pass swiftly into night. My food was all gone, and so I ate small berries that grew hanging over the water; they were earthy but sweet, the pits flabby and pink. There was no life that I could see in the pool, and it was a metallic blackness, the shade was so extreme; those three colours, the cordial, acid green of the foliage, the black of the water and the hideous white of that blistering road have stayed with me. 
	At this point I heard voices, though to me they must not have been voices, but rather the sound of water pouring, or the creak of machinery, or the crunch of stone on stone. But voices they became, a man and a boy, speaking in halting Queen's English, about the weather of all things! It was like Gibraltar, and seeing a policeman patrolling in shorts for the first time, tugging on his hot war helmet. I quickly donned my mask, and turned to greet them; one lone literanaut against some void of high air. The sight I presented must have quite amazed them, as the man stood stock still, transfixed, whilst the boy screamed and ran back the way they had come. The man was tall and fair, wearing simple cloth garments with few adornments, and he possessed a rather impressive cleft palate, drool swinging pendulous under his chin as he stopped. There was a definite rumour of the endogamist about that palate. He hastily wiped himself as I called to him, happy to be speaking my mother tongue after so many years amongst foreigners. He stepped forward tentatively, dropping the felling axe and sack that materialised from behind his broad shoulders, and stuck a shaking finger towards me. What if I had known, in hindsight, that the first words to be uttered to me by a man of Loss would be, “Where is your mouth, sir?”
	After I had gingerly pulled at the seals of my mask to show him that I was no ghoul, he inched forward, gave a short curtsey, and introduced himself as Flood Last Year. This was my first encounter with the curious nomenclature of the people of this valley, and in all my studies I had found nothing to prepare me for it. I asked him what it meant, and he replied that “his father had been a man of hate, and of his wife and children he could find no greater punishment.” I had no way to answer him, so I stepped forward, offering chocolate, until I stood very close to him. He smelt of dry-shaving, and was extremely nervous, tapping his fingers against his chest and clicking his tongue to some beat I could not hear. I told him that I was a friend, and that I had come a long way to find his town. His manner completely changed to one of derision; I remember him laughing at me, asking me to remove my mask, reaching around me to adjust my pack, and finally telling me that I would most likely be turned away, and maybe killed for my efforts. I replied that I was not afraid of death, and he hooted at me, ran his finger up the Orinoco of his lip, and told me he would make me tea, and that he was not good for much more. 
	He turned and led me back to what I took to be his home, a little way down the slope and off the track; he was a forester, and his abode, doubling as a tannery for skins and a smoke-house for wood, was a vaulted, thatched affair, of many floors, reaching into the canopy and erupting steam and effluvia from every opening. What struck me most, arriving amongst the dappled ferns and rabbit warrens, was the great copper kiln that was  protruded from one side of the hut; it was the likeness  of an obese woman, her breasts drooping to form a lid for the fire within; a great priapic extension stuck out underneath the flames, a sort of tap. He saw me looking, and told me it was his Mother Kiln. He rubbed one of the hose-like nipples, the copper worn to silvery opal with generations of gropings, and took me inside. Long, purple furs and puckered beds of sharp scales hung from every wall on long poles, sloughed off or cut from some great reptile. The smell was utterly appalling, and I was surprised that Flood, as he asked me to call him, did not also reek. Every wall were covered with racks of knives, purgatives and strigil, as well as what I took to be wineskins, but were more likely acids and curatives for his trade. Ladders disappeared up into the higher quarters, though a large hole ran through the centre of the building, allowing smoke from the large central fire to drift skywards. The floor was bare earth, and in one corner was a pile of tiny carved limbs, obviously broken from some larger piece, and tossed irreverently to the ground. The frightened boy whom I had seen earlier was cowering in a corner, playing with the bands of his clothing. Flood ordered the lad to greet me as a guest. The boy rose as bidden, and approached me and kissed me full on the air filter; I flinched in shock, and the boy shrieked again and took to his den. He was ill, Flood told me, and his father had asked him to be brought to the woods to get some work done. He tossed him a knife, and the lad began carving at the rear of a large sheepskin, patterned with dots and whorls like a bitten nail.  A true Occidental stupidity.
	I wished to be away, I think, as quickly as possible; a backwoods rube, even a friendly one, could irreparably damage my first impressions of the place I had travelled so far to see. After I had picked the bitter leaves he had given me in a broth (I imagine, from his interest, to see if I could drink through my mask) I asked him to take me into the town, at which I was warned it was a three hour ride to the gates alone; at my insistence, we trekked for half a mile or so down the path, leaving the boy behind to his work, and came upon another small clearing in the wood ringed with smooth shale; I was surprised at this, because of the obvious difficulty at bringing such material from the distant coast. In the centre of the cairn were a pair of bovine-looking steeds, heavy with one thick horn like a dull serrated knife atop their heads that pulled on their necks. I had thought them contemplating on the heavens when we arrived, though they remained so for our entire journey, peering up at me as if I had told a bad joke. On the horns were daubed the hand-prints of children and long, waved lines. They smelt pleasant enough for livestock, almost like healthy soil, or celery, and around their feet was long hair that trailed on the ground like that of a prize poodle, though the fur was matted and rife with lice. He helped me onto the beast's wide, palanquin-like back and set off at the pace of a canal-boat or a procession through tight streets. Flood controlled his with his hands wrapped around its stomach, clicking ferociously in its ear; mine was kept in line with occasional slaps and prods.
	The road was full of rebuffs and sharp bends, and despite my pleas for silence so as to nurse my aching backside in peace, Flood probed me with questions about the world, and where I had been. I gave non-committal responses, little more than grunts. I was careful not to ask him too much about his home; I wanted to hear such accounts from educated people, people that I was assured (here a short section of words if ruled through) meet in Loss. I do feel bad for Flood; he was a simple, ugly fellow,  seemingly a member of some caste unknown to me even now, and I perhaps should have been more courteous with my discoverer. Shortly after I arrived he disappeared back into the woods and the mountains, and no-one will tell me anything about his health or destination, nor that of the boy. I have still not been introduced to his father. Perhaps I was too harsh, though at the time I had sincerely hoped that his degeneration was not symptomatic of his people. I have simply written in my notebook that “perhaps all the beautiful did fall at Troy”.

            <Text>A Note On My Lodgings

	The only place more cramped and inhospitable that I have retired was in Marwencol, though I cannot blame the men and women of that place for their disabilities. I have sealed the door with my cloak, but I worry about the window; I have not slept with my gas mask on since Tintagel, and I do not relish the memory; the rasping struggle in every snore, the slow clouding in my eyelets, as if death was coming in my own breath. However, I suppose that the size does not matter, really; outside of my quarters the building is some sort of miniature Babylon! 
	Each floor holds different treasures; the buzzing I hear must be machinery or great pumps, as the river is somehow lifted from the canals below and runs along several floors above mine; people can while away afternoons on its banks, six storeys up! There are gardens full of produce that run alongside it with only a few windows bringing in the strong sun, and Friend has told me that the cellar is full of mushrooms sprouting on cut logs. One of the floors spirals inwards like a maze, before reaching a door that is locked to me. Above is something of a communal chamber; the samovar in the centre burns star-hot and blackens my ceiling in a tight ring. There is another lock on the hatch that leads up to the roof, though something is mooing or cawing up there; a basilisk, or merely chickens? At the moment no one will tell me; they just stir their soup in silence, whiling away the long evenings with thoughts and strange games which I can have no part in. They rarely speak to one another. There is a medieval darkness at night; I can only see the lights on the river, those of the dark fishermen. I saw their long poles ending in knives, though they seem not to use them; they leave their washing over them, and plunge their hands into the fast stream to bring up their catch. On my bed, when I arrived, was a large pile of coins, completely blank and around the size of an old penny; I seem to be able to exchange them for goods, but no-one will take any currency in like, and I wonder if they understand economics as I do. 
	I was given a souvenir at the Inauguration today by a rather senior gentleman purple with moonshine; it is a youthful looking moon, cast in heavy metal on a red cord, with a wonderful scalloped surface that is calming to stroke. In fact, I feel a need to do so now; my feet are bleeding and I still cannot remove my wraps. Maybe tomorrow.

In the foreground sits a tall young woman, with a frame of stark white hair. Behind her, a samovar bubbles neatly. She has one hand on the teapot, and the other points above her.

            <Text>The Sea Map

In the suitcase the reader will find a rolled map. The map is a military sea chart of an indeterminate stretch of ocean, with many annotations made in pencil. There is a Widsith Institute stamp with the legend “Chart ://9278B: Cape To Loss. Evidence Handle: Secret” The places printed directly onto the map have been crossed through. Its surface is watermarked, burnt and dog-eared; it has seen a lot of use. 

The annotations are as follows:

- On the reverse of the map, is a trade agreement. The map is signed by an inscrutable hand, and the agreement calls for “Nine Hogs And Gull Gall For A Year”. It has been countersigned by the Eremite. Beneath this is a list entitled “To Procure”. Its contents are as follows:

Ship’s Biscuit (Twelve Hands, Three Months)
Eligius’ Throat
The Planks (This Is Crossed Through)
Lute Of Growth
The Vine Book
Jenny’s Pendant
Tarot Harp - Tuned To Woodland

Below this is a small map of an island, hastily scribbled. It is labelled “The Red Isle”, and is covered in trigonometric lines, points of triangulation, and contours. The island appears to be Italy, except severed from mainland Europe and with a fjordic coastline where the border should be.

- Near a landmass in the north: “Cross the bridge backwards, thumbing St. Eligius.”
- Just south of this, with the symbol of a glowing triangle: “The Gorge Stone must be placed in the cloth, not the divot.”
- On a rectangular, numbered region in the ocean “She floats!”
- In the centre of the map, with the symbol of a circle: “The Breath Stone must be placed by a woman.”
- In the centre of the map, with the symbol of a hood: “Bring a hood to hide and peer.”
- In the centre of the map, surrounding four black triangles “The Foursome Colossi.” A line passes through them, with the legend, “Safe Route”.
-  A number of nautical navigations are placed across the map, with a compassing towards the east, where the degree is crossed through and replaced with various calculations. 
- A cyclone’s path is plotted across the map; its name is Irene.
- A trio of dots named “Sam’s Eyes”
- “The Red Isle”, as detailed above, is found near the centre of the map. Next to it is the legend “She must be crossed - there is no other way. Roll yourself on logs.”
In the lower centre of the map, with the symbol of a glowing square: “The Vomit Stone seems to fit sideways, but this will kill you.”
- In the centre of the map, with the symbol of a rope: “Bring rope to bind, then break.”
- In the southwest, with the symbol of a sword: “Swords to hack, slap and caress.”
- In the southern centre, with a pentagram - “Yours shall be larger in life - the size of Thoth, no less!”
- In the far southwest of the map, with an angled line: “ Fifty-eight degrees west. Bring amulets and prayers for them. 
- In the south of the map, titled “Your Chant”: “Ahem Atum, gross with gums, teeth with salt, finally halt, the stones you place, the degrees you face, cyclone spin, then find the thing.”
- Below the chant, along a coastline: “You will gain cancer here - look for the greened rocks.”

            <Text>Audio CD

In the suitcase the reader will find an audio CD, in a clear wallet, with a slip of paper inside bearing the logo of the Widsith Institute, at the head of this list is the title “Evidence Class 08367BBE//A: Scratching, Vellum, Eremite, Misc. Item DD19: Selected Recordings. DO NOT REPRODUCE.” Beneath this are track listings, along with some notes made, both in the hand of the Eremite and the official type of the institute.

Track 1: Item DDm02:// “A Short Repertoire Transmission By A Youth”

The song is a basic folk piece, with one shallow voice, the sound of birds and water, and a thin stringed sound, perhaps from a ukulele or mandolin. There is a key change that the singer struggles to accomplish.

When I step out that door
Dad's an expert at semaphore
He can send me directions
At twenty-seven miles or more

And I rely on my back
It's the greatest thing I lack
I'm a coward, I'm a runt
I'm the only sheep that's black

Gods of Grace, 
Gods of Time, 
Roll your eyes.

A cabbage leaf
Placed carefully
Gives me peace.

Through the sweat that I mop
I read a book by Mr. Propp
On the inside of religion
And the common knowledge shop.

It seems others went before
With more courage and more force. 
Superstition isn't much
When you're kissing lengths of gorse

I have my staff carved with lines
That signify an absent time
I am all those boys who left
And whose fathers didn't mind

Pick me up, gods oh gods
Be my fire, be my rod
Furnish me with scripture
And give me back my virgin's blood

Gods of Grace 
Gods of Time
Roll your eyes

Potbellies
And buttered bread
Yellow on red

Gods of Grace 
Gods of Time
Roll your eyes

Maybe then
I'll feel your gaze
That makes me ashamed.

The song ends in a coughing fit. 

Track 2: Item DDm003:// “The Farewell Song, As Performed By Discovering Leprosy, April 4th”

There is the sound of winding, of cranking, a click and a whirr, and low murmuring. Someone shushes a snoring voice tenderly, and then a deep baritone begins an a capella piece. 
 
My cloak is on the ground
It is the skin from which I drink
For I trust no stream I come upon
My sword my tongue and larynx

Farewell, farewell, farewell
The game begins in earnest 
Farewell, farewell farewell
My secrets are my own.

Oh gods die
Fade into the woodland
Oh gods die
My people are too strong

Oh team have strength
Have strength without my aid
Oh team have strength
My path I walk alone

I will not leave the path
Or tell the truth to strangers 
The blood will show me where to go
The maze, the roost, the dangers

Farewell, farewell, farewell
The game begins in earnest 
Farewell, farewell farewell
My secrets are my own.

Track 3: Item DDm003a:// “An Untitled Welcoming Waltz, Feburary 9th”

There is the sound of crowds, of laughter, clapping, shouting and dancing, and the tuning of instruments. A man approaches a microphone, which squeals in strange, rhythmic feedback and he coughs and tests the microphone. He is heard to shout something indistinct. The crowd begins to quiet, and, after a short count, a bouncing, warm waltz begins, with strings, percussion, brass, and many stranger sounds, like the calls of foreign birds. Voices rise in harmony, some tremulous, others strong and deep. 

Oh mountain goat
Low down your trumpet of stone

Oh scatterbird
Split apart in flight

Oh I am the mother king
I must have the fat to have my fill

I am like the wind
I age without touching

The orchestra’s song begins to warble, screech and fade to be replaced by a static overlaid with what sounds like morse code. Eventually this dissonance resolves into a muffled breathing and a steady dripping, followed by a gasp as if someone removing something from their own face. An artificially distorted voice begins to speak. 

Reminder: Breathing in, breathing out. I did not breathe out. 5 litres per lung, twelve thousand particles per litre, 120000 particles in each breath. Held
breath in. She made me hold breath in. 5 times 12000 times two. Breathing in, breathing out. I did not breathe out. I didn't breathe out, for fuck's sake. It's a 
coincidence. It's a coincidence. It's a coincidence. Come on. I did not breathe out. I didn't breathe out. Reminder Reminder Reminder. Erm... Success rate 2% 
2400 still operating. Healthy. Healthy healthy healthy. No symptoms. Mask on. No infection. No infection, mask on. Reminder reminder reminder. 

The voice begins to whimper slightly, breathes deeply, and is followed by a click and more static.  

Track 4: Item DDm005:// “Conversation On Last Night Of Sanity, May 17th”

There is the sound of bubbling, of distant rain and thunder, a regular tapping is heard, as well as scrapes, bumps and clicks. For a few seconds there is silence, and then a dialogue between the Eremite and an assured yet youthful female begins.

- Okay, it's ready. You don't mind having this here? 

- No. Just leave it there.

- Where can I sit? 

- Anywhere. 

- There aren't any chairs.

- You better sit on the floor, then. 

There is a shuffling, and a heavy sigh.

- A mess. 

- Yes. 

- It's nice to be away from the smell, really. 

- Is it? 

A pause.

- Do you like this?

- Let me see. 

A pause. 

- Wow. That's quite a major piece. Iron, is it? 

- I think. 

- Why do you need the knife with it? 

- I don't.

- Was it a present?

- Yes. 

A pause. 

- You can have it when I die. 
 - Excuse me? 

- You can have the wand when I die. No one else will want it. Or have it. 

- Oh... thank you. 

- You are welcome. 

- Why do they hate you?

- Who?

- The people who live here. 

- I imagine because of what I am. 

- A woman?

- The woman.

- What do you mean? 

- I’m all of those Men who cut off their little, generators or whatever you want to call them in polite company. It's easier to hate someone else than yourself. 

- You're like a totem?

- Is that what other people you've met call it? 

- Yes. 

- Being hated? 

- Yes.

- Then I am a totem. Can you take your mask off?

- I’m afraid not.

- Whatever you are protecting yourself from? 

- I am... ugly. 

- Really? Your physique says otherwise. 

- My mother forced herself upon my father. 

- I see. 

- I’ve never actually said that to anyone. I've just realised that I have never said that to anyone.  She was not an... attractive woman. 

- Did you inherit her... attributes? 

- Yes.

A pause. 

- I imagine you are starting to regret coming here.

- Things have taken a turn for the worse, haven't they?. 

- I would like you to say my name.

- Your name? 

- I just don't think you can. Tea? 

- Yes please. 

- Go on. While I'm making it, just say my name. 

- Alright...

The track fades to static for around seven seconds, before the Eremite fades back in mid-sentence.

- ...believe me?

- I do.

- I’m glad you do.... How do you know? 

- You can see these things. I'm also a doctor.

- The doctor?

- The only doctor. I see these things.

- Do you....

There are two seconds of static.

- No. I don't.

- Good. 

- And what about your girl? 

- Friend? She's fine. 

- What will you tell her? 

- Anything she wants to hear. 

- And when will you....

There is more static.

- August... particles....

The static climbs to a keening crescendo, and then cuts off.

The Final Track

This track is not listed in the contents, and begins twenty or thirty seconds after the close of the penultimate track. After half a minute of silence comes a whirr, and a few accomplished clicks. The voice of the Eremite, tired and dulled, speaks a few phrases. 

“Leftovers. July. Some fucking day. For posterity.”

After this comes a click, followed by a distorted recording. There are several clicks, a few shrieks, a peal of laughter and the voice of young woman begins to speak.

it hear me? Can it see me? Does it work with crystals? What's that little light? Oh! I think it sees me. Right, just put this down here... over... right, rightey
rightey right. Hello. I think you might be angry when you find this; I know you don't like me touching your things. But look at what I've got for you! (A rustle).
It's the last one of the year, the meats still fresh, and as long as you're in tonight it still will be. If it smells of apricots just throw it out, but I thought it would
be a nice gesture. You could make a stew. You can get coats out of them too, but it might be a little small on you. (Giggle). Only the ladies are poisonous, but
this one's, well it's a big one, a big boy! So this is for you. 
You're out again. Out talking and taking pictures, or walking with the Mayor. Wait, no, father's with the Mayor, so I sincerely hope you aren't with them. That
would be horrible. 
I've straightened your things, and hung up the picture I sent you. Father was sorry, you know, he really was. But, I hope you checked inside the frame. You
aren't the only one who can hide things! But I promise I haven't checked inside your suitcase. My family can keep promises. 
I saw the little girl from upstairs today. She looked terrible, her father as well, like they hadn't slept in weeks, and she was so dirty! There was all this ash or
soot all over her head, and I thought to say something, but he looked so awful I didn't want to make a peep. 
Erm, I've made a list of things I would like to do. I'm going to read them out. Oh... oh the light just went out. Hello? Hello! Oh, no, wait, there it is. I really
hope this thing is listening to all this rubbish. 
So, I would like to go to the Dexter's but not Sinister's, which is not allowed, you know, you have to go in both but we could buy something and just run. I
would also like to... kiss on the bridge, the one that looks a bit like a man lying down, upriver. We'd be quite close to Father but that would be OK. I would
also like to read with you. I know you've got all those books, and I would like to lie in bed with bacon in the pan and the window shut and just... read for a bit.
I want to show you the mushroom caves, as well. That's a good one, they're shut in spring but if we go down on the first of June we'll be the first ones in.
Right at the back there's one the size of a house which has been there for ages, and we can look at that. Maybe you can write about it. 
Are you writing about me? I'm just curious. Not that I would ever look, but I just want to know if you are. I like the idea of you writing about me. It makes me
feel a bit more... worth. If someone takes the bother of writing something about you, you must matter. Otherwise they wouldn't bother. 
I don't know if you check this at all, or if you just get rid of things without checking, or you'll hear this when you leave and you're hundreds of miles away and
forgetting about me. I don't want to believe her, but Trousers Whipping In Wind told me that you have been up to all sorts, with the theatre staff, and the
women in the butchers'. I don't think that's you. I don't believe her, she knows it will upset me. And I'm not going to ask you about it. That would be far more
grown-up of me. 
There's a lot of you I don't know about and that's okay. I don't really know much about anything. You kind of teach me as well as love me. Erm, I mean...
what... oh, err... Well, no, come on, I do love you. And I think you love me. And we're a bit different, aren't we? Everyone in this town is the same. 
So yes. I love you. I love you. I love you. It kind of sounds like a sneeze when you say it fast. I love you. Iloveyou! (Laughs). Well, I'm going to bed. Enjoy your
dinner when you get home, rub some paprika in it is the best thing to do, really. I'll see you tomorrow. Remember, bring boots and those overalls I gave you.
The shore's slippy.
	⁃	
Goodnight. I hope you're walking around out there writing about me. Not this boring place.  Write about me! Write about me! Remember me! (Laughs).
Goodnight. (A few seconds pass.) Goodnight! I haven't gone. But I am going now. (a few seconds pause) GOODNIGHT! (laughing and swearing as she tries
to turn the machine off).

            <Synopsis>A map of the K!K!K! field.</Synopsis>
            <Text>The K!K!K! Field Map

In the suitcase the reader will find a folded map, printed on much thicker, rougher paper than the others, and stained with age and use, its edges torn. It is a map of the K!K!K! Field. In the top left is the legend ‘K!K!K!?.!’, and the map shows an oval arena with a river bisecting the bottom third from east to west. The oval is filled with roads, forests, mountains, structures, tributaries and other features. The annotations in many different pens and handwritings, are as follows: 

In blue pen, in the north, is a range of mountains, with the legend, “Raise more mountains, physicians and contours?” There is a path leading up into the mountains, at the source of which is written “The Algebra Lizard”.

In the north is the symbol of a house labelled “Home And Father”.

In the north-west is a rectangle labelled “The Gaussian Tower”.

In the north, in red pen, outside the walls of the oval, is what appears to be a map of a cave system, labelled “The Selkie Gulag”.

Just south of this, a stain from a coffee cup is ringed in red several times, with the scrawled legend, “Where Beasts Meet To Be And Go”

In the north-east, surrounded by a forest, is a diagram of a football field labelled “The Boxing Knight”.

There are scrawls in the east in black pen, labelled with a weak hand, ‘I wave to the fields here.”

In the west is the symbol of a ship, labelled ‘The Aground”.

Near the centre of the map is a town labelled “Ajax”.

On the eastern edge are many chemical diagrams, calendars, and mathematical calculations, in the Eremite’s hand.

In the centre of the map is a tall mountain surrounded by a canal, but it is only labelled with a question mark.

On the rear of the map is written “X.???!!!K’.

An ink splatter to the east is labelled “Hydrogen Vats, various sizes”.

A rip near the centre of the map is labelled, on the reverse, “Here I left the Earth for good.”

A path runs outside the oval to the west, the passage labelled “Desire Line”. In another hand is written “Desire has abandoned us.”

Next to a large lake in the south-east is the label “I drew all the grains of sand in the shape of tiny stars, here. Build it. Hire the craftsmen.”

A single building in the south (though still north of the river) is labelled “You meet in a tavern.”

A cavern in the south is labelled “Mr. Light’s Hut”.

A maze covering a large area is crossed through, and is labelled “Whisper’s Staircase For When We Are Ready And No Longer Nervous”.

A floor-plan has a jagged line bisecting it, with the label “The lightning!” in large letters. Beneath, in a neater hand, is written “On his behalf, use batteries from the foreigner’s cache.”

A line crossing the river (where it becomes a series of small dashes) is labelled “The Stroke”.

Another hut in the very south of the map is labelled “Father And Home”.

A series of thumbprints have had lines drawn on them in an semi-circle, and labelled “The Amputheatre”.

In the east, a house nestled amongst mountains is labelled “A place to rest. No tricks. I shall have no tricks.”

A square in a vast woodland in the east is labelled “Here they still play the First Game. I want their ghosts.”

A set of stairs in the very south of the map, beyond the oval, is labelled “Steps For Father’s Aching Back, To Enrage Him.”

In the suitcase, the reader will find a sealed, rubber bag. Warnings of biohazardous material and health risks are stitched and stuck to its malleable bulk, and the symbol of the Widsith Institute is amongst them. If the reader opens the bag, they are presented with a grey rubber gas mask, apparently mass-produced, though with an ornate wooden filter and some customisation in the form of scratchings (apparently a sort of tally) and inscriptions and drawings across the whole of its surface. These include: 

- The words “AHEM ATUM” written around the filter. 

- Tears streaming from the eyeholes. 

- A large brain drawn over the cranial area, with one hemisphere labelled “MOTHER” and the other labelled “FATHER”, with lines connecting it to the filter, both of which are labelled “DEATH”.

- The words “LIES” and “THOUGHT” written on each eyehole.

- Around the neck is written a short poem: “WHOSOEVER BREAKS ME WILL BREATHE MY BREATH AND SEE WHAT I SEE.”

            <Synopsis>A small photograph of a woman standing.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Small Photograph

In the suitcase the reader will find a small, framed photograph. It depicts a large gate, a cobbled road winding beneath its arches. Before it is a windswept beach, and behind, over flowered meadows, a towering ring of mountains can be seen, hemmed with cloud. 

Attached to it by string is a luggage label, which reads:

Sir And Magus, 

My spawn sends her regards and apologises for the incident yesterday. She will be beaten, as per your request. 
Please accept this gift from both of us. 
Safe Travels, 

Death In Strange Light
March 16th

If the reader takes the frame apart, however, underneath the picture they will find a scrap of fabric, stitched with mountain flowers: it is the same material that Death of a Friend is wearing in photographs of her. In spilled ink, with a pained hand, is a small devotive message:

I forgive you. 
I am your pet. 
Sometimes we must kick a dog.

            <Text>Large Photograph

In the suitcase the reader will find a larger photograph, in a cheap frame. The technique of the photo is antiquated, and the paper faded and blotched. There appears to be little development or treating of the piece. It depicts a woman in her twenties or thirties, naked to the waist, the number “897” in the top right-hand corner, and a plain sheet behind her. Her impression in impassive. It is signed, in cursive script, with “L.E.A. 88”. Attached is a handwritten note by the Eremite:

	I purchased this in a covered market in the Old Town, in a curious section labelled “Butchery”, filled with framed photographs of nubile young women. There seems to be no periodicals, or magazines of any kind. Only these lewd portraits, evidentially quite old and previously owned; they are covered in fingerprints. I have seen little evidence of interest in photography in the town, with only children handling the antiquated, clunky sets that the adults drop to them as ancestral windfall. They have no markings of manufacture on them, and the film is produced locally from thin reeded paper. 
	I have never seen this practice before, anywhere else, but the pictures are incredibly popular; a fat woman from one of the neighbouring apartment blocks elbowed me out the way as I handled one photograph and snatched it for herself, before seemingly noticing me and apologising profusely. Every day that I go back there are new women, ones that I have never seen in the town, propped before velour, or what looks like alligator skin. The tag reads “L.E.A”, and I am told that these are the initials of Loam Exploding In Autumn, a rather famous photographer who had died only a few years before my arrival. It was obviously a popular choice, and I shall hold onto it. 

Drawn underneath the writing, it seems that the paper has already been used for something else. There is an intricate diagram of a shoreline, with many question marks, arrows and symbols relating to wrecks, sandbars, submerged rocks and reefs. A single, thick arrow, marked “Safe Passage”, cuts through them all. </Text>

            <Synopsis>A heavy iron totem.</Synopsis>
            <Text>The Wand

In the suitcase the reader may find a long, heavy totem, seemingly welded together from dark, dense metal. It is a wand, a ceremonial tool carried by a holy man or woman. At one point it ends in a wicked, tripartite blade, its length carved with serpents. Further up are atlantids, the gnarled features of demons, symbolic representations of thunderbolts, and at its pinnacle a small, smiling dog’s head. Several smaller Long Men Tails are tied to the middle section. Attached to the wand is a wound piece of paper, torn from the journal, in the writing of the Eremite:

Reminder - The Caduceus. The faces here seem to be gods or demons, or merely leering tumescents; traditional culturo-religious ideals would definitely render them malignant. The orb-holders in the central panel seem to represent lightning, perhaps relating to the Long Men Tails attached. The thing is a weapon of war, to be sheathed and buried in the mud in all times of peace. The knife imbues the wand with this martial air, though the witchdoctor, or savant, or whatever she was, was the most peaceable thing I had ever met. Given the town's ritual revilement of her, perhaps it was a tool of defence, in case their hatred ever boiled over. She told me that she often found folded notes left on the routes of her quotidian rambles, promising all manner of death.

She was like every pretty thing that has ever been sacrificed by the lowly. 

She was a sister of the beauties of Titicaca (though their teeth were green with furred mange and emeralds) and the naïve priestesses of Sparta. The latest in a long line. I wish she was around to ask. She has only my guesses now. They left only a fist around its length, and a tatter of armoured hair. The ring of spit was scuffed by the march of souls. They had come for her while she was brewing tea. </Text>

            <Text>The Tarot Harp

In the suitcase the reader will find a strange musical instrument. In construction it is an autoharp - a form of zither popular in the 1930s for its ease of use and interesting, resonant sound. This particular model is made of dark, thin wood, inlaid with a floral design. Each of the chord buttons, and the strings, are named on thick, papyric parchment. 

The chord buttons are labelled:

Crisis
Road
Stars

And the strings are labelled:

Sword
Key
Raven 
Lake
Chest
Monk
Beast
Hero
Cloak
Elder
Castle
Pipes
Princess
Pauper
Blood

When plucked or strummed, the strings seem dissonant, unreliable, as if the instrument has been stored incorrectly for some time. 

On the reverse of the harp is found a poem, written in the Eremite’s handwriting on the same parchment, and affixed with thick glue:

I will scan, iron muscle
I will guess, bowel rustle
I will run, voice giver
I will love, tune shiver
I will jump, finger lover
I will sing, hole mother
I will tell, story seeker
You will know, I weaker.


Attached to the harp by some means is a officious-seeming note headed by the Widsith logo. 

It reads:

Artefact Report 98238923://JJ Loss File

Item 12 Argus: The Tarot Harp

Scriber: T.W.A.I.N.

One C.F. Zimmerman 1886 5-bar “Shifter” model autoharp. Miscellaneous elements damage, salt rot, abrasion consistent with ijolite erosion. Strings have not been replaced since manufacture. Customised with extended cavity, tuning schema and rear-sided paint palette built directly into back plate. 

Personal Notes: He seems to have customised the instrument for his own purposes: what do these demarcations on the notes and chord buttons signify? He calls it the Tarot Harp; figures here do not represent traditional tarot arcana. </Text>

In the suitcase the reader will find a huge, ornate key. It is flecked with bronze going to green, and is inlaid with geometric designs and the symbol of crown punched into a loop at its head. Attached to this loop is a tightly bound scroll of brown package paper, into which is woven a metal clasp. It looks impossibly old. Within are various signatures and promises, laid out almost like a comic strip. It appears that the scroll has been ripped and repaired many times. The legends are as follows:

I am the Mayor of Loss. 

It is my duty to keep the paths closed and the way hidden. 

It is my duty to keep this key from the door. 

It is my duty to murder for the good of Loss. 

It is my duty to refuse welcome. 

It is my duty to stay beautiful. 

It is my duty for the children to learn of devils and gods. 

It is my duty to laugh at those gods, and lead others in the laughing. 

It is my duty to keep graves empty and the river clean. 

That is my duty. 

I am the Mayor of Loss, and this is my key.

In the suitcase the reader will find a heart made of plaster, and painted in bright, primary colours. Many of the ventricles, veins and passages are carved and painted with the Tachygraph. The heart can be split and two, and the hollow within is anatomically correct. Painted on the inner surfaces are tiny dark figures, cavorting slaughter and war. The heart is wrapped in brown paper, with a luggage tag that reads:

To a Friend, with love.

Inside there is a slip of paper tucking into one of the ventricles, that reads, in the Eremite’s hand:

In the journal the reader will find a print far more well-developed than any other, showing a tall, thin man, dressed in a strange combination of cloth, fur, rubber and feathers, standing before a screen holding floral designs. The corner of it has fallen to show a wide plaza filled with people; some are playing instruments, or chasing each other, or dancing. The man wears a wreath of strange, lightning-shaped paper symbols, and holds the instrument that is to be found later in the case, along with the gas mask included. He wears a long cloak, and has a flower pinned to the mask near the filter. The legend reads:

            <Text>Feburary 22nd

	I am a small man. I am five feet four inches in height, “the proper length of an oorang”, as Brutus loved to remind me. I have acne on my shoulders that irezumi has failed to swallow up, back ache, gallstones, a septic thumb from playing with my reflexes at Tom Wat; it is still swollen, and that girl still rises, black almost to a shade of green in my skull, where I left her weeping, my thumb weeping. The litoral of my hair is gone floating with the rub and heft of the rubber that I must wear, and my backside sweats if I sit too long. But these men and women are not my betters; they are almost Neanderthal. The tallest of them do not even reach me, and their chests are quite pigeoned; perhaps this is why only a few of them will scale the mountains. In my first days emerging from my dwelling they milled around me like buoys against a sandbar, confused and confusing in the clothing they wear. Their names are long, heavy constructions, and each seemingly a story; I met Young Bird Snared By Badger, his younger, petulant brother Badger And Emphysema, the dancer Uncle Felled By Gorse and her babe Cycle Crash By Moonlight; and yet they are so unwelcoming when I ask of their etymology! They tell me that they make them angry, or happy, and will offer no more. Why on earth would someone choose a name that brings them only irritation? They will not tell me. Maybe others will. I have time enough for that.
	Coming downstairs on my second day I met two serious young men racing out of the main door to the apartment block. One was slighter, paler than the other, and his soul seemed to know that it was sickly; he is not seen to smile. The other is heavier set, and tanned; he obviously sees the outdoors more. Maybe the first one is a writer, I remember thinking. As I engaged them with a rap of my book against the wall they scratched to a stop, shuffled nervously, and introduced themselves as Discovering Leprosy and Love For All Gods, and I realised that I had taken photographs of them on my first day here; I had met so many people I had forgotten about them. They said that they were sportsmen, though Discovering Leprosy gave Love For All Gods a sharp look when he said this.   
	Death of a Friend follows me, every time I leave the building; I never see her door open, and I am wary, for Mr. Lights, her father, most definitely hates me; no one else has fallen under his spell, but I hear him shouting about me from my room, and the few times we have crossed paths in the last few days he has flashed me a look the likes of which I haven't seen since Alexandria and that delightful little kelpie. I have no wish for a shotgun wedding in this place, no matter how beautiful it is; the harpoon has left its traces in my thigh before. But when I am crossing Main Street, with gibbering children following me, trying to gift me souvenirs and their parent's prized chattels in exchange for pieces of my costume, she peeks around the doors and windows of the mullioned tea rooms, or tries not to splutter as she leers from the shop that pours acrid smoke constantly, and wishes me good day. Our paths seem to cross an awful lot. 
	Today, though, she came to my door, and offered to show me more of the town. I had yet to explore much deeper than the main thoroughfare and the channels and bridges surrounding the water and my apartment. I agreed; her dress was short and I was sick of what I had seen. The back of her legs were like a piebald velour, that shimmered when the muscles moved.
	We walked through the tributaries and the high arching bridges in blocked granite, where those long lightning strips trail into the water. As I peered over the railings I saw the terrified ripples of living things, a shimmer of scale or chitin amongst ghostly arenas of frond and paddle, and I asked what they were. She giggled, peering over with me, before sending an arcing spittle past me and answering, “fairies!” I must ask her about her heritage, and watch her brow for any Cro-Magnon abutment. With her father fucking the Mayor, who knows what forks in the road her ancestors took. There were signs on every corner, tall and yellow against the dark windows, that forbade the dumping of corpses or urine into the stream; the black outline of a prostrate man was on fire, small, regular black grains of him falling into the stencilled waves below. 
	The apartment district, the smallest sliver of the great terraces of Ry'leh, an organising hand sweeping away the tracery of dead gods, opens out into a wide plaza where the official buildings are found. The scaffolding constructed for my welcome, thrown up in under two hours by teams of bored youths, was still standing. I was due at the Town Hall the following day to see the Mayor's collection of maps; it is a tall, utilitarian structure, with no obvious doors or windows, no entrants or exeunts, like all of the buildings around the square. I can imagine Ioseb as I knew him, with a patterned tribal scarf around his neck, wearing the suit of a savant, his beard full of pork jelly, walking in the pure strident noiselessness between these places, touching the stone with hand suited for moleculars, and smiling at how smooth is was, how perfect, how unmarred by chisel or transport. I had no idea how they were constructed, or how men or women entered them for business; perhaps the Mayor wished to test me. 
	I strode slightly ahead of Death of a Friend to take a photograph of the entire plaza. Without warning, however, she ran at me, crowing and baying and calling for me to stop. I did so, ruffled by her intrusion, and she pointed to a Venn Diagram inlaid in gold and red bone in the cobbles. She pointed out that this was the Execution Venn, whatever such a thing means; she explained that anyone stepping inside the rings, guilty or not, would be executed by the Town Council. Such a thing seemed laughable to me, and I hovered my foot over the ring, as she pulled me back from the border. The cobbles seemed so clean! I felt that she must have lied to me, to impress me. 
	We passed an edifice that could only be religious, great suppurating mounds vomiting rainwater from the night before into the waiting mouths of not-gargoyles, not even grotesques. It was as if someone had draped a dead, heavy-breasted colossus over the structure, fusing its mammaries with the stone, the memories of its tubes flowing with calcite and limescale. She looked at it, suppressed a belch and clicked her fingers at it, once, twice, a third time behind her back. I looked at her, and she frowned and motioned for me to do the same, though I would not belch in my mask, as only I would suffer.
	We headed from the square into small streets that run in all directions, high walls and hedges holding chapels or museums that no-one visits, or the lowing of great mysterious beasts. People dodged to and fro between ancient buildings, some of them wattle and daub, some timbered, some made of pristine metal. There were shops and cafés; I felt like I was in Europe again. We stopped to drink what I thought was coffee, but was more like a sour, black, syrup; she asked me which books I had read, and I tried to list them, starting from the beginning. I think that she was pretending to know the titles that I recounted, as every so often her head would bounce and she would grin and sigh into the near distance, as if remembering a certain plot-twist that we could both share. 
	It grew dark as we set off back to the square. Someone had lit the street-lights, and I saw then what these huge bulbs were for. Death of a Friend called them “the universe”, as if she had some concept of 'universe' that I was unaware of, though I had to admit that the lights within could be imagined as some primordial borscht – they spread out like bright acid, in long lines, pulsing and casting an eerie glow over the whole square. I think of Tesla. He would be more suited to such a trip.
	We mounted the steps to a vast rotunda, again portal-less, only the statues of vast men and beasts, all of them being tortured by vile devices or projections. Both Friend and I searched for any crevice or depression that might give a way an opening, before there was a sharp click, and a small man, so frail he seemed to be a man of motes, a man of dust, appeared in a monolith of light. His voice did not waver, as he began to scream vile murder. Friend stepped forward, obsequious and quivering. 
	The man stopped his commotion, smiled, and apologised to Friend. He beckoned us inside. The girl had revived the old bugger, and he introduced himself as Spider's Nest in Barn. There was a touch of the double Humberts about him, busy fingers, woollen vest, filthy, crenellated ears, veins that ran through the stout bulkhead of nose and pipe. He finally recognised my presence, and asked me, by way of greeting, when I had last had sex. I started at his impertinence, before remarking that it had been three months, and he wove a little sign on the air, danced a small jig of happiness, and remarked that he was still a virgin, before lambasting foreigners in all their guises. I did not know whether to console him or celebrate. He breathed deeply and showed me into the library that he curated. He noticed the velour, also. 
	It was small. I had imagined phalanxes of scrolls bound in alligator teeth, or letter suspended in viscous jelly, or lights that played across great steel screens, or tablets and statues that would give me something to read; something spectacular. But there were three shelves of books, one of them a collection of pulp adventure stories, yellowing and thumbed heavily by oily pads, I bawked at this expression of otherness that seemed to precede me, seeing one pressed open on a small table beside a rickety ladder ascending to a loft. A phrase jumped at me from the page, and I thought that I had imagined it circled, but it could not have been; the cloak hid him from the heathen eyes, and the darkness brought him. I asked the little chap, politely, if there were any more books. He snorted, and asked the need. I was inclined to agree with him, and worried; was Loss not what I had read of? Was it this scruffy, muddy town, with none of Rome's glory, or Ethiop's palaces, or Glastonbury's trilling masses and bleating sacrifice? Was it merely the last suction of these inbred limpets before the disappeared into the deep of the mountains, the oceans I had crossed? I resolved to spend much of my time reading, and proving myself wrong. I had not travelled as far as I had to be disappointed and to leave without answers. Perhaps Friend can be persuaded to tell me more. I cannot keep writing her name out in full; it is too long. She is just Friend, now. 

An Essay On Ancient Lights
	Any building in the town limits may rise as high as is feasible and physical, but may not spread more in width than five times the arm-span of its lawful owner. There is a certain quaint concept of “vacuum light”, received from space and unsullied by air, that each person has a birthright to strive for. 
	Each building conducts its own, private Babel, basking in venerable rays that lance towards Earth from their ancestral home – that is, anywhere but here. MacArthur was right; I have finally met my little green men!

FRANK BESTIARY 

Being A
Diverse Menagerie
Of The Singular Valley Of Loss

Compiled In The Year That Hatred Found The Mayor, Young Love In Spring, And He Ordered The K!K!K! Field Razed To The Ground, And Was Executed For His Crimes




















Commissioned By Loss Town Hall, The Time That Muscles Popping Lifting Grain Cut Off His Wife's Hand With A Scythe, And Because Of Her Ugliness Threw Her Into The Pageant Weevil's Nest At The Point Where The River Splits And The Glacier Melted, Consigning Her To Death And His Children To Ignominy

Printed By Grace Of Funds The Time The Strawberry Seeds Came By Stranger's Pack

The Amoeba On The Windowsill: The Scatterbird

For low to the ground, the scatterbird is seen. He is a fulsome crow-shape, black with black talons, a wrinkled inky beak. He feasts on the insects and diverse fruits of the field; he is wise as we are, though, and will not touch the circling beetle, the retarded poisoner. He lives in the field, in long grass, or wheat, or beet plants; he luxuriates in the cover of night and vegetation, and is rarely seen on the ground. Though crow-like, he is large, like a dog, and waddles painfully and gainlessly over small obstacles as if they were eyries capped in ice. A rather ugly, shoddy gentleman; more like a rutting hog than a bird of the air. But, such a transformation! Such a sea change, when threatened, or approached! A farmer will enter his field; a flat plain of swaying, whispering crop, a slingshot in one hand, a whistle in the other. He casts the stone far into the scrying pool of his property; the scatterbird is his foe on the ground, for he churns the fields to mud and breaks the stalks of his harvest. The stone clatters to the shrub, and the whistle blows; four or five scatterbirds lurch into the air, lethargic and duggish, no more than three hands above the wheat, and there they split. Those dark shapes, atavistic as soot against rock, divide as myriad forms; the large, rolling drudge explodes into twenty, thirty flitting things the size of sparrows, and where there were five, now there are hundreds, and the farmer's field is blotted out by these living colonies. Each fat crow-thing is a monastery built of the bodies of scores of sparrow-things, living together, feeding together, but jostled apart, cowardly and ultimately alone, to slink back under the cover of night and fuse once more. 

The Crippled Scapegoat: The Pageant Weevil

For everywhere is the Pageant Weevil to be found, and obvious by its colour and its gait; it is bright and primary, each patterned different from its kin. It is positively mathematical in its disability, slowly walking in regular ellipses to transport itself across the ground. One would be tempted to think this a cruel play of nature, though Man, in all his wisdom, is the architect of this creature's injuries, for its sin and for his own. They can be seen hermetic and in solitude, away from heat and population; they have a shared, almost religious terror of humanity. One must be sure to look past the ridiculous heraldry and the pitiful condition of such creatures and see the true venom within. For there is a sinner's poison, a malicious seeking of heat and light that draws these beetles to the feet of revellers, farmers, children and hunters, sinking their long mandibles into the soft flesh; exacting a sort of mortifying, necrotic revenge. For these creatures are tarred ludicrous by man, and catalogued by him; parties of townsfolk, elected by the town hall, head into the fields and woods with nets, scissors and paintbrushes; children are sometimes brought along, sheepish and feverish with fear, to teach them of the Weevil and its dangers. The insects are discovered in long brush or the bark of trees, in colonies of four or five, and are fastened in place with netting and long callipers. Held thus or with careful hands wrapped in muslin they are painted and varnished in vaudeville lines, and their front left leg sliced off. They must then be let free; one must be very careful not to kill such humble things, as even a single weevil destroyed results in mysterious proliferation in all parts of the valley, with more poisonings and more work. However, few are now found with a bare shell and a full set of legs, and most of the nests are marked obvious with Long Man Strips and bright paint. No cure has been found for their poison, and this battle will continue this way; the patrols that document these slight enemies bring a gross communal ecstasy, and we must be vigilant to protect our children from the horror of that first spark of poison and painful death. We shall lose few more, by Whisper.  

Lo, Bright, Stupid Master: The Turkey Dragon

One need only to gaze up at the herald of our clandestine urbanity, garlanded by fluttering Long Tails, the lacquered shields and sentinels that gaze droopy-lidded over our leaders and committees and songs, to see the great and awful Turkey Dragon, our carnation and our greatest shame. She no longer exists in her natural state; the only specimens still breathing are the inbred dynasties cooped in this urban pavilion. She is a heavy, drooping slug, reptilian and feathered, a cockatrice whose stare only invites hilarity and ridicule. She has four legs, though they all are withered as grapes becoming raisins and are taloned roughshod and unkempt, with wide, greasy hairs diversely spread. She blunts her claws on rocks as she stumbles onward, and sprouts membranous canopies, though canopy is too illustrious a term; they are shrubs of wings. Her heavy beak is filled with teeth, irregular and crooked, shattering and cracking the keratin as she grinds the rotten meat and vegetation she is fed; she produces the most godly stink. Great porcine tusks nudge their way from her mouth, narrowing her gut and reducing her breathing to a mousey groan. She is, by all true standards, a waste of life. And yet we see her as beautiful, and hated by the gods, and so she is ours, our sacred, our prow. Fewer and fewer have been born in recent years; witnessing the violence and unhygiene of her mating habits, it is no surprise. She is the last of the valley gigantics, and the most tragic. We give her an annual stipend of cutlery and billy cans from the Kettle Guard's barracks so that she can form her own hordes whilst in captivity, though they are small and pitiful compared with the treasures from our greatest dirges; zeniths of stolen metal, secreted under the mountains and in great nests built of mucus that cap the highest peaks. They are our greatest songs by their fleetness; for we may not know them long. They may shuffle back into the caves and hollows of our heads, scraping sparks on the walls with their wide, turgid skulls and clumsy sharpness, the last, spastic light before they slump into the dark. 

The Compass And The Coral: The Cartographile

Upon following the channel of the serpentine river that cuts its way through our great valley, wending as it will through homes, taking solace in the fields, burrowing into the maze of the pitch, the chill of the water, the tumbling ice and rock that forces spume and foam through channels no wider than a child's breadth, it seems impossible that anything could survive in the tempest that runs out to no sea, much less anchor itself in place; however, below the surface of the river, like a millipede scaled, the cartographiles have given us the names of paths, the nature of hidden places and the temples that we may build. One has never been seen in its entirety, being some miles long, it hugs the bank almost from source to delta, knocking against its sleeping companions. Their long mouths hold nets of needle teeth, that filter and crush debris that tumbles down from the mountain and the town. They possess thousands of tiny legs, more like hooks and stunted as if in a bumping womb, that vice to the bank with the temerity of a saint. They regard the maelstrom above as sanctuary, and though their backs are armoured and serrated, they turn their plump, pustulated bellies up to the sun. This trust, and lethargy, grants them their greatest virtue. Their bellies are long ranks of acne, stretch marks and scars that can only be the product of the boulders, branches and bodies that dance down on the top-stream. Yet, apart from the gods and their reason, and by the power of man and stupidity, these lesions are the maps of our surroundings; a precise cartography in rude nature! They show the tracks that loggers use to reach their shrines and kilns, the floor plan of the Town Hall, each yearly construction added in the some chaotic line of sharp flint tumbling down from its perch to score open flesh. Some say that one particularly senior creature holds the plan of the K!K!K! Pitch, though the Town Hall has denounced every rumour-smith identified as murderers, thieves and foreigners and hung all until dead swiftly. If one can brave the tumult, and the carnivores and jitter-weeds that frond and billow just below the surface of the stream, one can feel out the road to one's own home, or that of a neighbour, or perhaps the secret paths that lead out of the valley; appeals have been made to remove and skin one of the cartographiles for better study of its dermography, but talks are slow, and the beasts slumber, oblivious in their pubescent cataloguing of our world.

            <Title>8 Scribbled Note About Compass</Title>
            <Synopsis>Rough notes on geography, astrology and the position of the Sun.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Feburary 23rd

Have realised that my compass is useless; as I lie in bed, it moves one way, and then the other. This morning the Sun seemed to rise in the North. North is now East? Ask Mayor. It would not be the first time that I have seen a community determine magnetic direction by means other than sense. Despite pleas to reason I am forbidden from intervening.  

A few lines break, and then a different pen and a slightly more manic hand. 

Have asked Mayor. He told me that there was nothing wrong with my compass. He even asked for it as a gift, in an awkward moment that these people seem to relish, and I had to mutter apologies and complaints of sickness in order to leave. 

Lots of small and large scribbled diagrams, full of calculations on date, position and time, and on theme of compass points, astrology, and other attempts to render sense in the town's geography. 

The mountain is apparently north – What is the basis for this. It is the grandest peak – what a ridiculous assertion! I have seen children clicking their fingers towards it as they leave their homes for school – a game? A rite of passage? Pubescent transformation? More interviews. 

-Magnetic field? 
-Sulphur? 
-Technology? (crossed through) No – too advanced. No evidence of quantum logistics that one can see. But those damn machines! I know that they exist!
-Magic? Proven in Avalon (Faerie) though there affected only one's mind, not geography itself – consistent with Prospero's Law. 

Reminder: Samples tomorrow.

A small, scribbled map of the town, and a point marked with a cross out to the west, and a small drawing of a deep pool surrounding a small island, with a picture of iron-clad boots, a harpoon and a lobster pot next to it.

            <Text>Reader, 

This transcript represents the experience of receiving, and experiencing, the suitcase in which the Loss project is contained. All writing is preserved in its original position, and descriptions of the various objects, and their manipulation, have been included to simulate handling them in real life. The order of the work is considered by the author to be the best structure for the narrative, but in actuality the project can be read in any order, with differing results and revelations for those who dig into the piece a little deeper. It should also be remembered that this work was originally intended as an experience for the novelist and tutor Sam North alone, and in this draft that distinction has been maintained. As a final point, this draft represents the final revision of the physical work; for the digital edition, further changes are needed.

I hope that you enjoy Loss, and remember it.

            <Title>9 K!K!K! Extract 1</Title>
            <Synopsis>First study of the Loss sport.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Feburary 22nd
	
	I cannot understand how I have been here nearly a month and have never heard of 
K!K!K!, the sport which everyone seems to adore but never watches, or speaks of, especially not to outsiders. It appears the 'season' is upon us, and now I cannot traverse the Main Street without incessant caterwauling reaching me from the tavern and from shop fronts of current players, fashions and gambles, all taking place upon a pitch that they nor I have never seen, yet takes up more area than the town itself. Why they are forbade from spectating is utterly mystifying. They string great banners between the street-lights and across the narrow streets of the Old Quarter, showing a wavering line traversing trees and ending in a lineal maze that seems to have no significance other than itself. There are strange, shelled jellies on sale by the dozen, wrapped in quilting that are sold from stalls that seem to have transferred via osmosis from the slum flats, and the hawkers are quite extraordinary; fat grandfathers whose lower arms are completely obscured by a clear membrane, as if they have been birthing a calf and quite enjoyed the affectation. 
	The name is indeed strange, even by the standards of this singular place; I do wonder if they have any knowledge of what such a name would mean to anyone of wider travel and historic interest. I have asked several people as to its true meaning, and am told that it is something like a command, or an announcement. The closest approximation I can find in the town library's records is the phrase “Mother Is Asleep”. Such an ejaculation, as usual, is to me senseless; I tire of this town's impenetrability. Nonetheless, the game seems to strike some sort of happy panic amongst them, and I cannot ignore it any longer. 
	Neither Friend, nor her father, nor the Mayor, would tell me anything interesting about it, either sworn to secrecy or ignorant of its intricacies. It seems the only person willing to speak to me is Spider's Nest In Barn. He told me that there was very little documentation on the sport (as seemed to be his answer for everything; I sometimes why the town bothers maintaining a library at all), and that as an outsider I was unlikely to understand it, and  that I should really just go back to my apartment and stop questioning everyone; people had enough to worry about. The old fart was being rather rude, and after more questioning, and a short disciplinary dig into his flat foot, he relented, and began to tell me what he knew. He told me what little he knew, perhaps not the whole truth, but enough to make it worthwhile. His knowledge seems archaic and mostly obsolete by the standards of others. It is a game quick to evolve, and bewildering even to those who had been brought up with it. However, I found myself much more capable than the librarian gave me credit for. 
	From what I gathered the sport is less a competition and more a mass theatrics, albeit theatrics that no-one but the players witness; I had seen similar rituals in the Pyongyang, but never at this scale or with this absurdity. Apparently, depending on who one asks, it began as a simple ball game amongst the youth of the town, who liked to disappear into the forest for days at a time; sanctioned legend says that it was one of several gifts passed down to the people by some dimly-remembered faqir named Whisper. I am surprised that a town of such proportions and apparent civilisation would still put such stock in prehistoric ideals; there is a poetics there, but one that even I find abhorrent. 
	Nowadays the game of an arenal, a series of challenges to be overcome by the participants on an individual basis; much like that of the Moroccans in Rome, or the Minos' contests, though far greater in scale and ambition than these or anything I have witnessed. Everything about it warbles change, mutability, and the unpredictable. The season is announced at a seemingly random time (which explains my entire ignorance of the thing until now), and the prospective players can apply to the Mayor, in person, to take part in the match. Though I am unsure as to the selection procedure, if they are accepted they must pledge to leave behind their ordinary lives and devote themselves to the game, for however long it lasts. Again, this is an unknown figure; games, he says, can continue for years. I asked where such lack of observation and stricture comes from; I explained that where I was born, rules and restrictions were very much a part of life. Spider seemed very interested, asking me more about my home, whether anyone killed themselves, whether women were allowed outside, and seemed to chew on the word “police” like it was arcane, something that gave him power. I still have not seen any evidence of law enforcement here; whether this is a quaint anachronism or genuine harmony no-one will tell me, at least with any coherence. The people of Loss are quick to laugh, though much of what they tell me, no matter how ridiculous, is accompanied by stony gravity.
	I pressed for more details on the game itself, how it is played, but was met with incomprehension and bewilderment. I asked if anyone would ever try to sneak into the pitch, to see it with their own eyes. Spider waved this idea away, saying that people were happy, and always would be. He is a very stupid man, sometimes. I do not think he has ever met a young person, perhaps not even when he was young himself. 
	He was ruffled and ill-tempered by this point; he was not good at company, and even less good with books (I have seen him eat gruel over an open manuscript, and I felt like screaming when a splash oozed its way into the spine). He told me that it was mainly young men that were picked; I also learnt that I was living with two former players, the serious young men Discovering Leprosy and Love For All Gods; he called them buffoons and fond of women, but admitted that they had been great players, in their day. I have made a note to arrange an interview with them. This is next to useless. 
	As I have already mentioned the pitch is forbidden to everyone but match officials and the players themselves. I remembered my first day, high on scree with the Mayor spluttering and gifting me laryngitis as I breathed in minty air and saw the leviathan forest that stretched past where I could clearly see, the bottle-green canopy broken occasionally by an alien shape, as if an ecosystem had grown in some vast rustling ocean that I was not privy to, a slice having been dropped and fossilised in rarefied alpine climes. I made a resolution to hike to the forest edge, to see, as they say, what I could see. 
	It was late by then, and Spider was mumbling into his chest, occasionally fiddling at his conical, downy skull, constricted – I imagine – by his mother's thrifty womb. It looked like he was slowly slurrying into his waistcoat, as it often does when old men grow weary. He was mumbling about a herald, a town cryer, a trumpeter, and at this I started in my reverie and questioned him, prodding him from eventual sleep. He gestured at the window and pointed away to the South West, up a trio of mountains that seemed clenched, almost tense together, as if seeing something on their far side that we were not party to. Through the mounting dark I could see the nerves that the lights in a house make, far up in the mountains, alone and almost monastic. Finally, it was explained! What had woken me at dawn every day since my arrival, that atavistic nuisance which made me think of trolls and long tunnels in the earth, but the town cryer. Apparently he announced and closed the games with a great yodelling trumpet constructed into the roof of his quarters. He appeared to announce everything else in town as well. Perhaps he announces his own bowel movements. The frequency of his blasts, so to speak, would attest to this. Spider said that the man had a door that led out into the world from his house. That he peered through it, and called back down for others to follow him, but that his invitations were lost in the wind. 
	I bid Spider goodnight; he is growing tired of me. I doubt I will gain much more from him.

            <Text>The Appearance of the Suitcase

The suitcase originally appeared on the desk of Sam North, atop  a pile of his regular correspondence. It is a red leather travel case, worn and battered, with exposed stitching and metal clasps, but otherwise unremarkable in construction. Covering its surface, however, are filthy travel stickers, warnings and proclamations; it is evident that this case has experienced a lot of use, and that’s its own is a seasoned explorer. Some of the stickers state “Property of the Widsith Institute”, and others display this name alongside a strange symbol of ranked lines resembling a house or building of some kind. There are other stickers, some stating the word “URGENT” in angry, red lettering, others proclaiming its danger, or displaying the biohazard symbol or other international signs of warning. Most, however, are souvenirs from imaginary places; stickers from Agartha, from Camelot, from Ys. Others claim that the owner has been to Biarmaland, or is a member of the “Lyonesse Wet Toe Fan Club”, or that he “died and saw stars at SHANGRI-LA”. Tied to the handle is a bronze crescent moon, the metal scalloped and worked, as well as a luggage tag which bears the inscription “Return to: The Minerva Broken And Battered Women’s Room, St. Luke’s Hospice, L.A. 28856.” Sam North’s office address, along with many stamps, duty-taxes and airmail vouchers is fastened roughly with tape to its face.
The case is opened easily, the two metal clasps opening with a click, and within are all of the objects described below. Atop them all, however, are two objects; a thick, black journal, and a letter, addressed to Sam with another large “Urgent” stamped across it. </Text>

            <Synopsis>Second study of the Loss sport.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Feburary 27th

	A bad day at every turn. Friend has been in some sort of state for a few days; whether it is  Charybdis stirring things once again, or I have actually done something wrong, I do not know. I can recall nothing. Women, wherever they are and whoever they pray to and whatever they stick through their areola, are all the same. I bought her a present from the small casino in the First Loss Hotel, and wrote her something of my own. Even this won't bring her around; she accepted it with a tight smile, and went back up to her room. I do wonder if there is someone else, a little backwoods boy that guffaws when she lets him sniff her. The weather is appalling, a sort of wet mist, and I can see nothing from my window. I resolved to try and speak to Spider's Nest In Barn; if he was still in his filthy mood I believed that I could torment some answers out of him.
	Surprisingly, as he made the library door materialise, he was perfectly happy. Whether he feeds on misery and mist like some sort of celibate incubus I do not know; it is not a wild theory; he is a pathetic fallacy that confounds all. He was very willing to speak to me, and I thought it was as good a time as any to ask more about K!K!K!; it had been a keen subject all over town recently, but I was not privy to any match gossip. He seemed to be polishing a photograph, but would not let me see, and locked it away in an armoire before sitting with before a table, across which was scattered the library's paltry offerings on the sport, like a man with too little hair and too much pomade.   
	According to one Laytunt Pracsees Of Noball Sport, its author unknown and its spine cracked, the pitch is completely surrounded by thickets of evergreen woodland, a First Age crop that seems to be almost prehistoric in genesis. I asked to see a map of the layout, but was told that the mayor had the only copy, and used it as a doodle pad to improve cogitation in key matters. I balked at this irresponsibility, but Spider said that it was in fact rather encouraged; any changes that the Mayor made to the map during his term would be added, in actual construction, to the pitch for the next season's match. Only the Mayor, however, knows of the whole geography of the arena, and the labourers are blindfolded and fiercely guarded when actually building these impulsive structures. He told me of Buying Groceries In The Sun, a rather clumsy burgher of a hundred years or so ago, who set his wet coffee mug down and inadvertently added a vast arena to the north-east of the pitch. Apparently the thing took three years to build, and the workers were sworn to utter secrecy, with some actually being dragged to execution for refusal to keep silent. Any such change to the pitch, or the rules, is usually a celebrated happen-stance, and is to be taken very seriously, though the populace must be jubilant from a distance, watching the silent green mass of the pitch edge from across fields and through the filter of pure rumour.
	The players are divided into two teams, though it is entirely unnecessary; each player is awarded far more aplomb if he works on his own, and is encouraged to lie to and deceive everyone he encounters in the field, even his own team-mates. When I asked Spider what the point was of calling the groups “teams”, or even having groups at all, Spider responded by retreating going to boil us bones for tea in a tiny samovar in his cubby, and leaving me with two thin pamphlets, both coloured with shellac. They seemed to be a pair – one showed a network of veins, leading to the next, where they became connected to a set of legs, amputated at the waist yet seemingly in jubilant motion, skipping along a dirt road amongst finely detailed trees. I did wonder if authors and artists in this place were reluctant, embarrassed even, to autograph their work; art, here, is treated much like a penchant for cats and selective gardening was viewed when Richard was king.
	Below I have included a sketch of a K!K!K! Player found pressed into one of the pamphlets, showing him in total arraignment. The kit itself is simple; light cotton smocks, braces to hold it all up, or in, in the case of the fat ones, more like the gym wear of a child than anything else. The player's names are emblazoned in heralds across their chests; their names, in fact, the only thing that the players are not allowed to lie about whilst playing the game; Spider states that anyone found to have obscured their chests, with mud or their clothing whilst playing, is dealt with most harshly. The amulets and fetishes strung about the example below are personal taste, and vary from player to player; as always, K!K!K! players take their superstition seriously enough. Mobility is often impaired by the triptychs, illuminated images, necklaces, pendants and scrolls secreted about the player's person. The staff is wreathed in lightning strips, though I found this no surprise; these symbols are fast becoming tiresome in their ubiquity. The hood and boots, in the shape of a bird's talons and beak, are personal to the player depicted, a certain philanderer of several generations past, a Yipping Dogs Bellied Sun who was forced into the game, so the text states, to “soothe his underside with a lack of caves and glut of trees and air.” 
	I have found other players, and their costumes, in further illustrations, incorporating elements of mythology, zoology and even gastronomy as sartorial inspiration. One particular example had his entire head covered by a elephantine gland, arching out over his back and constantly dripping steam from his panting breath. There were scratches in the paper beside the drawing.	
	The small sphere tied at the waist waist is called the Cerebellum Clandestin, and seems the most important part of the game. Within is contained, on a spiralling, microfilmic canvas, the entire life story of the player, in excruciating detail, down to the last minuscule action, related to an independent official in a long series of talks long before the player even begins a match. I am not even sure what it would be used for, though, I suppose, that is down to the player entirely. I should love to get my hands on one.
	I asked Spider if he had any more books. The secrecy and lack of exposure is maddening. He completely ignored the questions, passing me a mug of grey gristle and water, and asked me whether I had met the Mayor's wife yet. I took this to be a joke, or an insult, and tried to ask him what he meant, but he told me that he had to tidy up, and took my mug back from me, pointing to the door. I noticed that a complicated series of pulleys and ropes lifted the whole panel free with a swiftness that belied its primitive construction, and noiselessly the menhir was gone, and I was outside.  and made my excuses and left. The mist had resolved itself into rain, and great sheets of it undulated over to the west, wetting the treetops of the pitch and waking its denizens, ready for the players to be announced, or to disappear. I must try and speak to the two men from my building; they might be willing to actually tell me something useful.

            <Title>Map Of Loss</Title>
            <Synopsis>A map of the town of Loss, drawn by the Eremite. </Synopsis>
            <Text>The Map Of Loss

In the suitcase the reader will find a bound map, on thick ridged cartridge paper. Opening it a map of the town, drawn in confident, black strokes, is revealed. It sits in a valley between high mountains, apart from to the west, where it is bordered by a forest covered, in this map, with question marks. A river runs from east to west in the south, and a path descends into the town from the north. The Eremite has covered the map with annotations, found below: 

Concerning a field in the north-west: I do not know what they grow here; it whirrs at night. A crop of crickets, or serious cyclists.
Concerning the road from the north: My origin. 
Concerning the forest to the west: The limits of the K!K!K! Field. The question marks are present on the original map Its span is massive, with close-grown conifers and votives, fetishes and icons hurled into the undergrowth. I have seen men hurling spears through the tree-line in between swigs of liquor, but none of them ever cross the threshold. 
Concerning open space to the south-west: Here are fields, woodland, meadows and grazelands: the Mayor says that it has fallen to him, out of all in history, to plough this for housing. 
Concerning a mountain in the south-west: No-one must go here. 
Concerning the western end of the river: A black castle stands where the river enters the K!K!K! Field. Friend tells me that it is merely scaffolding, and that it is not inhabited. 
Concerning the river: The river has no name. 
Concerning the source of the river: A great waterfall here, simply marked “Absentation” on the Mayor’s map. In person it is icy cold, and springs from the rock as if staff-struck. A cave at its base is popular with children debating. 
Concerning fields in the south: The Beetroot Fields - the plants are freakish, eighteen feet high in places. The townsfolk seem to eat it at every mealtime, boil it for tea, and harden it into balls for their games. 

There are various other signs on the map, including: 

Woodland
The Shrine Road
My Tent
The Boundary
Town Hall
Fence
Old Town
Main Square
Execution Venn
My Building
Spider’s Library
River Walk
The First Loss
Typhoons Here
Feeble Zenith
Cunt’s Hut
Weak’s And Goud’s
Backbone Cafe
The Zoo
Mr. Light’s Hut
The Boardwalk

The Boardwalk
Chernobog

Two other features are prominent. There are several compasses drawn across the map, all of them with the cardinal points in different positions, and sometimes a compass will feature two norths. At points throughout the town, as well, are drawn symbols of flames in a rushed hand, in a different ink, with many question marks and calculations involving pressure and wind surrounding them. </Text>

Inside the envelope, the reader will find a map. The map is carved into a piece of driftwood, and on its reverse is a sticker with the Widsith Institute’s logo and the legend “Property Of The Widsith Institute. Do Not Remove. Catalogue:// 831RU12e”. The map resembles the Pacific Ocean, with Asia on the left and America on the right. The islands of Fiji, Samoa, Hawaii and Cook are marked clearly, though they appear to be encircled by huge landmass, that stretches from Hokkaido in Japan down to Peru. It is labelled with the word “Humen”, and all around the coastlines of the Americas and Asia are various phrases, marked by crosses. They read:

            <Text>April 9th

We shared dinner in the common room this evening; of course I had to eat alone, in my room, but as soon as I was done and replaced my mask I joined the group. Almost the whole building was there, though the quiet man and his daughter had apparently excused themselves as soon as they had finished eating and retired for the night. Some sat and chatted about things that required frenzied hushing and fidgeting with their dinner knives and lines of salt that they eventually brought to their mouths on wet fingers, snorting at the strength. The adults drink from dented tin mugs, but the children are given slender wooden tubes that, when blown into, produce a honk that sends them into fits of giggles.
	They let the fire burn down to a shimmer in the air before disappearing. I walked Friend to her room, and she kept trying to stop me in my pace, but I was itching to speak to Discovering Leprosy and Love For All Gods about K!K!K!; they were out at harvest almost every day, and this was the first opportunity that had presented itself in weeks. When I returned and tried to rouse them to conversation they were cagey and reserved, playing some card game that involved them slapping each others hands like schoolchildren. Most people had gone to bed. They finally finished their game, and I poured them both coffee. 
	Gods looked out the window, mostly, as if expecting somebody to cross the street, or perhaps sulking at his loss; it was hard to tell who had won the game they were both so grave. Leprosy was more open. He had done better as a K!K!K! Player, completing a match in less than ten years. Gods rose without a word and left for bed, without even nodding back at us. I saw him pocket something on his way out, something that sat heavy in his pocket. When he had shut the door Leprosy leant forward and told me that he had been dismissed from his match. I asked Leprosy to elaborate, but he refused. Their friendship is close, and mainly silent. They are, after all, farmers at heart. Though I am close to them, I'm still the Eremite. Maybe its the mask. I have been told that the children don't like it, that I look like a cow's skull on a stick. 
	I asked Leprosy about the match itself; I still knew little of the actual mechanics. He pointed to the window, and told me that the town cryer blew his horn at the start of every match, and at its close. The players are grouped at the Gables, elaborate huts that are almost like grand wickets, or an extensive warren that is “safe” in the style of Bulldog He drew me a sketch on a scrap of paper I gifted him, though he is no artist, and I worry about his recollection; he has festooned it with fetishes, paintings of deities and sweeping beams. 
	Next the players line up, facing the tree line, the edge of the pitch, with numbers of paths winding into the trees. They then sing Whisper's March, the ceremonial start of the match. It is a catchy tune, as close to an anthem as these people have, and you may often hear people whistling it as they work at meat or accounts, or hammer the beat of the middle eighth on the poles of their hoes. 
	I set up my recording device before asking Leprosy to sing it, to provide me with something definite; out of guilt and pagan shock at seeing my device he began to recite it softly for me, barely over the whirr of the machine and the crackle of the fire, so as not to wake Kicking Sods Into The Sea, the tumour-ridden geriatric who doesn't seem to have a room in the building, but haunts the bathroom attached to the common chambers, pulling on the netty cord and playing the pipes like a marimba. He woke anyway, and grumbled and shoved us out, before returning to his sleep and his crisp toes, propped by the oven. 
	Retiring to my quarters, I asked Leprosy to explain the small bottle hanging from the belt of the K!K!K! player in the picture I had found; he told me that it was a vial of scatterbird blood, caught and slain at the beginning of the match and given to the players to do with as they will. I asked him what he had done with his but he had merely shook his head, fiddling with my Tarot harp. The pig-headedness of these people! He has a tendency to fiddle; he is nervous, slow by personality, uncharmed by celebrity; he resolutely ignores the girls that coo after him as he goes about his day.. I asked him what he did when he was let into the woods, at the start of the match. He turned to me, smiled for the first time since I had met him, and told me that he had split from the group, and run off on his own. He is a very ugly man and rebellious, scared, feeble and foolish; from what I have heard, he is the best sort of player. 
	He told me about Child Sleeps Through Fire, the first ever player to win K!K!K!, nine years after Whisper had supposedly given it to the people of Loss. He said that he had seen the champion, in the woods, two months into his first match. He had been in deep woodland, he said, and he had spied a ruined castle on the next rise; something ancient, perhaps Stygian, “the very type of wrong”, as he so eloquently put it. It had not stopped raining in two weeks, and as he searched for a way to cross the wide, lazy tributary that blocked his path, the man had floated up the river. I asked him if he was dead, and he said that I did not understand, that the man floated above the water, like Jesu or insect striders in my mind. He trailed his feet in the water, and floated straight past Leprosy, up and around the bend of the river. The water boiled as he passed. I could imagine him, trailing ribbons of prehistoric cotton, his staff lax in one hand, his body emaciated and and pulsating with sag. It seems that there were forgotten things in the woods, things that even the Mayor did not know about, but I grew tired of wondering who was lying. 
	I asked him if this had happened. He told me that it had, and turned in my cubby where he had installed himself like a child allowed to stay up late. That was that. I could not ask him again. The way that the man had looked at me was enough. 
	I never really understood, in all that he told me, how points were scored, how rivalries were settled, whether the teams really mattered at all; he told me about the Whisper Cross-Section, the great maze, the caves, the mountain and the Aground, a huge wrecked galleon sunk into the rock and filled with spirits; all of them are challenges to be overcome. He would not tell me who, or what they contained, what armour he wore, what swords he plucked, what maidens he kissed. Friend had told me that the pitch went under the mountains, under the town, under the river; beneath our very feet; he wiped the scar on his hand, the lateral one that has the shine of a pie casing, and swore at her, softly, smiling again. He called a “civilian”, with every hatred there that an army sergeant has for the peasants that he must ferry across no-man's land. He too, seemed to carry something. He was bent by it. He produced small nuts from his gown pocket, and as we ate we devised a game of flicking discarded shells into the corners of the small travel desk I had brought with me; the inkwells served as goals.
	The game (K!K!K!, that is) seems to end if the Mayor gets bored, if any one of numerous prophecies is fulfilled, if the sun hits the bark of a certain tree in a certain light; there are many more conditions. The Town Cryer is notified, and he blows his trumpet again, and the players must turn back from their journey, and return to where they began; like all good heroes must, I imagine. Leprosy took me to his room and showed me his vial of scatterbird blood; it was dusty and empty. He told me that when he heard the trumpet, he was the only one who made it back; he had lain a trail of blood, winding through trees, back home. He did not wink, and I knew that there was no Grimm contained amongst the Haggard and the yellowing Munsey in the library.
	Those who return to the Gables, whether triumphant warrior or dejected failure, are greeted by the Comeirh, a ceremonial, costumed role. His sketch this time was subdued, his hand hesitant, and there was a fearsome mismatch of beasts, a Nemean monstrosity, raised up on stilts and furnished with four legs, tusks – every protuberance imaginable. But what took me most were the eyes, and these he spent many minutes on, shading, filling with colour. They were dead, those of a puppet, this was sure; but the way that beasts can look through you was not there; they were the eyes of an accountant, of Anubis and Thoth, of a judge or your own mother, something that may know you naked, who treated you as the idiot son, the wastrel, or the runt. With all the solemnity of a Mason, he said that he was then asked to tell the Comeirh everything he had done in the forest. He had completed very few challenges, in all truthfulness; he had run, for the most part, lost, pissing in mulberry bushes. But he lied. He told Father of the Algebra Lizard, fighting haunted helmets, crossing the lake with his pole, bridges for mice, band-saws that walked and danced in great convents. It poured off of him like sweat. And he was believed. To this day he still recieves gifts, letters of love, professions of admiration and endless favours from his fellow townsfolk, in an example of those minuscule religions that exist everywhere; he is like a saints, but almost opposite, the epitome of the deceit that is so integral to the game.
	He had nothing to drink, and it was that late, childish hour when men like to, so I led him back to my room and let him demolish my stores. I asked him about other matches, other players he had met; had he ever killed anyone? He cut me off, called me an arsehole foreigner, kissing me on the forehead; I did not think that he had drunk that much. He then climbed into my bed and fell loudly asleep. I tried to rouse him several times, but eventually left him and went walking. I climbed the building on light feet, but Friend's father was asleep outside her door, an extinguished cheroot on the floor beside him. He was dreaming of running or chasing, the way he was twitching, as a dog does. I thought it wise to go to Leprosy's bed. He had left his door unlocked, and I entered. A huge pile of letters was stacked on the desk, and the bed was slung with filthy clothes that blocked out the light and the husks of nuts long eaten. The desk held several rolls of maps and jars of pens, and I finally had time to study them. There were scrawls of wide ovals, burrowed penmanship, deep ink in the table, fury that he could not hide. He had scrawled names, questions, interrogations and interviews with himself into that paper. It seems that he was trying to draw the pitch from memory.

            <Text>Letter To Sam North

On top of the other contents of the suitcase the reader will find the letter described above. Upon opening it, you find a number of typed sheets, the pages crisp, the paper the doubled-punched variety that one used to encounter in old printers. The typing seems to have been done on a typewriter, but there are no smudges or blemishes. At the bottom of each page, inside a heraldic flourish, is a Latin motto: “Iam Adveho Verum, Deus, Verum Adveho Iam”

Urgent - Do Not Ignore!

(Here is the symbol for the Widsith Institute once again, the form of a roofless house composed of horizontal lines)

Extraneous Missal ://Category 8543021

Date: (The Date Has Been Blanked Out)

Signed: Level 14 Commissioner J.U.N.G.

Scribe: Level 4 Clerk T.W.A.I.N.

The Message Begins

	Welcome, Mr. North, to the Widsith Institute. May I congratulate you, and by extension my own judgement, on being accepted so speedily to join our ranks. I hope this package finds you in great financial, physical and spiritual wealth. 	
	May I also congratulate you for not dismissing this missive as refuse, or indeed panicking and summoning a firearms expert, thus igniting significant barriers to our business. It is a credit to you that you will readily accept the strange and irregular into your working day. 
	You are now a member of one of the world’s largest and most mature organisations dedicated to the esoteric. I may tell you that behind you stand a long legacy of writers, explorers, magicians, politicians, royalty and, though we may not be certain, a cadre of deities as well. It is my pleasure to inform you, also, that a search of any database or directory in existence for our credentials will be entirely fruitless. We pride ourselves on our commitment to the clandestine. 
	The benefits of such a membership are substantial, and shall make themselves obvious in time. If a lowly scribe may be permitted a personal aside, my own life has been improved immeasurably by joining the Institute; before I was both poor and blind. 
	Membership is, of course, free, and recruitment is entirely at our discretion. 
	All that we ask in return from our members is the utilisation of their unique talents in several concerns that we maintain at all times. In the vernacular of the day, these are mysteries, scryings, the world beyond the world, etc. This, as a writer, should not come as any surprise to you. Your work for us need not impinge on your day-to-day life, and may even benefit you personally. 
	One of these concerns sits before you. The author of this collection, the owner of this catalogue of possessions, is named the Miasma Eremite. We have been searching for him for some time. 
	Some explanation may be required. The Eremite was a recluse, an idiot savant, a liar-poet; he fancied himself a bard, though his songs were grey and dull. But his failings were not outweighed by his talents. He was a traveller of many miles, an amateur anthropologist, and a recorder of events. I make no comment on the quality of his observations, but he was extremely proficient at noticing everything around him, indiscriminately. As cataloguers ourselves, you understand his appeal to us. He cultivated an uncanny ability to venture to places previously unexplored or undiscovered. We followed his work with interest; he was in the caverns of Yalta as Stalin and Churchill sat above, and read verse to the urine-wizards of Canada. But, as we say, he was a liar. This is of less concern to us than to others who record and annotate, but, at times, accuracy and the truth must find their way into all records. 
	You may have noticed that I use the preterite in regards to his being. His being has ended. He died a year ago in Australia, halfway into Uluru. We mourned the loss of such a distinct personality, but were happily able to secure many of his belongings at private auction. We have spent much of the last year, and much of our assets, analysing the bulk of the collection. This suitcase remains one of the most inscrutable. It concerns his journey to Loss.
	Loss is a very singular place, one that we have been searching for for many years. It appears on no map, in no histories, its people unevident in any modern ethnicity. All we had was a name. Loss. And the Eremite, reputedly, found it. The severity must be made clear with another personal aside; I have stood on the basalt of Atlantis, and I have yet to learn of even a speck of Loss. 
	What is contained in this rather malodorous file is his report on Loss. If you are astute as we know you to be, you will ask how we know that this evidence, with no external measure to justify it, can be trusted at all, especially as the Eremite was a proven delusional and liar. Permit me to explain. 
	This is no cursory fable, or the imaginings of a lonely child; there is an evidence, of sorts. Even if all of this was constructed purely to deceive, the maps, the recordings, the minute detail, the artefacts; if the man truly believed he had visited Loss, then his deception is enough to be worth documenting. I have said, above, that we are interested in the esoteric. This man’s mind was most hidden, and if he chose to spend six months within it instead of the valley of the First Grief, we still maintain that there is worth there. Posterity, of any kind, is the greatest reason for records. 
	And so it is with great pleasure that I inititate you into a vast network of similar souls toiling across the globe at this man’s legacy. But, for you, is saved the most glorious part. The last truly hidden place on Earth. In reviewing your credentials we saw that your passion for lies and misdirection is unparalleled. You must not take this as a slight, as others may intend it; this means that you are perfect for the interpretation of the words of another man of fiction. Your role is simple; please review all the material that you have been sent, and note down your opinions on the veracity of its bulk. You have a proven record for inhabiting fantastical worlds of your own; it is our greatest wish that you will be able to tell one from the other. Do not doubt yourself either; we do not require an expert of anthropology, or etymology, or geography for this task. We require a master of lies.
	I have included my own notes and opinions on the content of this collection; I hope that you do not find them too intrusive. You may take notes of your own, and we will contact you when we feel you have spent enough time with the piece. There is a global deadline for all those working on the Eremite’s profile, but do not feel the need to rush. It should also be noted that you will find some referenced pieces missing; it is regrettable that much of the material that we recovered was too burnt or watermarked for proper analysis, and had to be disposed of. Other material has been removed by the Institute for its insalubrious content, though I hope that you will come to understand the need for such censorship. 
	We hope that you find success and pride in your work. This may not be part of your usual schedule, and you may be tempted to put it one side and attribute it to a prank by one of your students, or the results of a bad dream. It is no dream, Mr. North, and we trust that your personality tests and your phrenological profilings do not lie; you will open the case. You are eager, as we are. I will end with a note that we pay very well, and will make sure that you are recompensed for your time. It seems ugly to close on such incivility, though we hope that this will persuade, if your own artistic integrity will not. 

You should have no need to contact us, but if you do, we shall contact you. 
It is my advice that you begin with the scrapbook. 

Safe travels in Loss, 

Yours sincerely,

            <Synopsis>A diary entry relating to an exploration of the town. </Synopsis>
            <Text>July 3rd 

	He finally died last night. Mr. Light has finally stopped pretending that he has any chance of living, and died. I helped Friend baste him with tar last night, leaving him to rest like a Christmas turkey in the common chambers, and set him alight this morning, floating him down the river on a makeshift raft that I pulled together from abandoned street worker's poles and the nets of fishermen..The flames burped as they touched the tar, and when he had dissolved utterly his burning fat turned into a thick, musky soup that drifted downstream like some malignant, sentient carpet mould. His clothes fell away before this, as if at some preordained signal, and I saw that his member was tiny, wrinkling in the fire like a dead leaf. I pulled Friend's head away, but she almost seemed bored, and turned back to the apartment district, dragging the small trolley of provisions we had collected. She may be crying, but as her face is always wet now I cannot tell.  
	As I write this we are in my quarters; Friend refuses to go back to her own. It is nice, in a way, to have her to stay, finally. The night is very dark with no fires to light it, and the sweet smell of the pines now meld with the mealy crust on the water. The once-leaping torrent is an orange waste, full of mud, poison and the dead. The town is quiet. We are the only two left. I thought a few days ago that I saw others, stripping a tree of half-cored fruit, a precision set of dentures that moved as one, but it could have been raccoons, or one of the impossible things that live here, driven down from the mountains. I feel no real urge to write; we spend our evening throwing the last scions of the mushroom caverns onto the fire, eating them browned and tart from the wood and peppered with eggs the white insects laid a few weeks before. The black ones lie poisonous on the griddle. This whole town seems like a giant trap, now that I have no one to show me where to tread. I wish there was more to read. I sometimes want to dash my brains out against the floor, but then I sit instead.
	Friend will not speak. The advice about the poisonous eggs in our meals was one of the last things she said to me out loud. I may as well be alone, as she does not seem to care what I write, or the fact I am writing; I head into the town to bring her food that she heats over the stove, staring into the cracked tiles painted with lurid flowers against the wall behind it. She lets me kiss her, but with no enthusiasm or hint of wanting me, and when I tried to reach up her skirt this morning she climbed back into the bed we cannot both fit into, even with the closeness of lovers, and my hand slipped down as her legs moved. I want to help her. She does not display any symptoms of disease yet, but her eyes are baggy and her cheeks are sunken, rickets and kwashiokor settling in. She is still very pretty, however; not beautiful, but there is a pinch of what she once was. I will find her some chocolate. 
	My trips into town for food have been augmented with research; with the people gone, animals have begun to materialise in the town; Genial Wort, the stubby deer they breed here, scatterbird splitting in great squadrons that multiply as I approach scenes of carrion. One thing I must note is that I see more and more of the pageant weevils, at first massing only by the river and the docks, but as the days go on they have reached the Main Street, and their hive must be close by.  Many of them have all their legs intact. Such a thing helps me, to see that at least someone is benefiting from this mess. I still avoid them, though, making sure that I can see the newborns as I walk, brown on the road, unpainted, seeming to guide their less-fortunate parents.  
	The Mayor's death has left the Town Hall open like a grieving thing; rot and silverfish jam themselves into its layers. I realise that underneath this steely façade the structure is just cheap wood, varnished and warped by years of supporting the weight of the outside. The doors that opened for me only at the behest of officials now hang like a dislocated mouth, and a acacia has leapt forward like a tongue of green and purple flame, extending into the sunlight. Ash is arrayed there like a solemn beach, and, listening for the tell-tale scratchings of weevils,  I risked a final trip inside to search for artefacts. I remember my routes very well; I did not want to get lost. The statues and busts were mostly intact, but many of the rooms were locked, or seemed to have disappeared. I wish to salvage something from what I have done, but I fear that much of this town will perish with its inhabitants. Some new, thuggish myths will shoulder their way into history, and squat over the town, letting it die and thinking of the lies they can tell now that everyone is dead. The bust will be reworked into new smoothness, and no-one will know a human ever signed a document or tickled a woman's back in this horrid place. 
	I found the missing rooms today. They are in the south, past the river, stacked atop on another, the furniture broken or fallen in their interiors. Some of them are already becoming overgrown, and I heard a strange whirring from within a long kitchen painted with bluebells, as if some machine had started up afresh. 
	The Mayor's office was unlocked, the carpet grown with spidery blue mushrooms that swayed in the movement of my entry. I would have picked them, but I saw that Book Burnt For Secret's papier-mache volcano was rooted in the centre of the room, growing fungus and fur, infested with lice, termites and arachnids. I remembered that he had used bleach in it, and burnt his hand, and so turned to the desk and the bookshelves, the one-way window that looked out across the western forests. Only one of the drawers was unlocked, and there was the official key to the town, a bright gold still, and reflecting off the bloated ceiling. It was the very same one I had touched on the day of my entry into the town, and seemed to be the only thing not growing a musty coat of rot. Without thinking I added it to my growing pack, and as it got dark I brought it back for Friend. She regarded it without speaking, and I had her pose with it for the camera, beseeching her and offering her ham and sweets. The heiress of Loss, with her birthright. The town now belonged to her. She was the only one left. I realised in that moment that I have no idea how old she is. I have asked her but she just sleeps. I am thinking now. 
	The ash is starting to settle in this capsuled mountain air, but there are still black, foul-smelling spores, like human hair, that settle on everything that does not move. Every morning more and more of it is gathering in drifts six or seven feet deep. Yesterday I went to the edge of the K!K!K! Pitch, to leave a token for Discovering Leprosy, and found that a wall of edelweiss and chrysanthemum had exploded into growth along its border, run through with briars, marjoram and all kinds of herbs. The ash is feeding the soil, and it all seems futile, really, our little hollow, cooking and keeping it tidy, when the place is beginning to overgrow and decay. It seems that the secrets of the K!K!K! Pitch will die with the town; I can find no way into the pitch, and I keep seeing the dead man float up the river, and I am frightened, very frightened. There is a castle, or maybe a folly, at the point that the river enters the pitch – but the gluey consistency of the water keeps me from it, and I must look, trying to guess if those stones were quarried hundreds of years ago, or if they are merely plaster, painted and to be viewed from afar. 
	An hour has passed, and Friend has gone to sleep with a bad cough. It seems stupid, now. I have taken off my mask as any benefit it may bestow seems wasted; she has seen my face once before, on that night we decided it would be right to kiss, and she said that I had the most peculiar mouth, and the most brilliant eyes. I have never destroyed a people before. My breaths and their contents do not matter. I should never have tried to go under her smock, that is what really matters, here.
	It is startling how quickly the pathogen can enter the atmosphere after I take it off; it is a hard thing to wear all day, every day, and you learn to crave your own company so that you may remove it. I had only taken it off for a moment to kiss her. And yet, how was she not dead? Surely she should have died first, breathing it in? Maybe they are all wrong. Maybe I don't carry this damned disease. But it does not matter, now. There was no point counting all those breaths, all those cubed units of air, all that dividing and multiplying. It did its job. Bravo, (Huge amount of crossing out here)
	I thought I saw a light to the north, a few moments ago; as if the sun was hitting the mountain as depicted on the town's seal. In all my time here I have never bothered to check if the sun really does rise in the north as they say. I will check tomorrow. It is all I can do, really. But there is so much, and I am a small man; I cannot carry it. There is so much I do not understand, that these stupid, secretive folk would not give me. 
	Tomorrow I will find medicine for her, something to make her feel better, and try to break into the K!K!K! Field. I have things to pick up. Things to catalogue. There is still much to do here.  
	I sign off here, and commend myself to you. I hope I have been of use, given the circumstances. I may see you again. I will take her to Minerva's. Look for us there.

Feasibility Report 12

Feburary 6th

AN APPRAISAL CONCERNING THE REASONABLE ADMITTANCE OF ONE “JOHN CABOOT”, A TRAVELLER, AND ACCESS OF THE TOWN THEREOF, FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD (EQUALLING NO MORE THAN SIX  FOR THE PURPOSE OF RESEARCH

Report Made and Signed By: Death By Strange Light, Liaison To The Town Hall and Master of Phylacteries

This report, to be delivered to the committee this Spring First in the Year That Crocus Blossomed For The First Time Amongst The Brubbage Ribs, must make clear that the man such as this John Caboot, who even know is installed patiently, I must confess, on our borders,   must be requested to leave peacefully. He poses a danger to our health, our way of life and the base sanctity of our community. I must respectfully impeach that he is removed at the earliest opportunity.
I was amongst those that witnessed this man ride down into the valley along with one of the woodcutters. His appearance, to say the least, was frightening and unwelcoming; a long vestment, high peasant sandals for riding, his haversack stuffed full with dangerous shapes, a strange wooden augur at his side clutched in one gloved hand, and a ghoulish mask on his face, with glass over his eyes and a long trunk where his mouth should be. Such an individual, with such evident malice, could not enter our lives as a friend. His visage is an invite to war.
Though the man has abided by our wishes to remain outside the town gates until this report is published, he has shown little respect for any of our other purities. He constantly coquettes with the girls that come to watch him by the gateposts, but ignores the boys that follow them; he has often thrown them scraps of paper with mysterious passages scrawled on them, strange food from outside the valley, and trinkets and baubles that he pulls from his pack. My own daughter will rarely come home before midnight, entranced by this exotic wight who claims to have crossed the dark sea. I propose that his presence will only provoke a dangerous ambition within our young, to our detriment; the outside world is a tempting lure for the young and stupid.
How this man found his route here is a completely separate matter; when quizzed by myself earlier on in the week, he stated that he had come “writing in the saddle, pouring drink to us, ready to drink with us, to work demons with us.” Even if such an odd statement were true (which we have no way of verifying) the thought of a fugitive conjurer (or whatever his provenance must be) cataloguing our way of life is complete anathema to what this civil thane believes this town stands for. I have asked him for credentials, and he has only given me scraps of paper with strange symbols and ranked lines upon them, more spells and problems for a town with enough of its own. 
If these uncertainties and dangers were not enough to warrant this man's ejection from our community, I would like to draw the committee's attention to the Hidden Press, in its wisdom, and I know that I draw no friends with this tactic. Though the word of the Press is no longer writ by law, its teachings still hold some value for this humble servant, and will, hopefully, have some bearing on the committee's decision. I speak only for Whisper, and his eternal absence. His wisdom still moves me. Let it move you. 

I have consulted with the Mayor on this matter and he shares my fears. I respectfully request that the man be led to the edge of our domain, given fresh water and sent on his way. I propose no violence (unless made necessary by his actions, merely respect for tradition and the safety of our way of life. 

Your slave in all, sirs,

Death In Strange Light

(Here is found a strange sigil, depicting a frowning, bearded face)

REJECTED By Order of the Town Committee and the Mayor.

Stranger is to be allowed access to the town for half a year to study and observe the town's people. Discretion must be exercised. Stranger to be billeted in the dead lecturer's room at the expense of Building 4's commune tin for the duration of his stay; however, the rights of Ancient Lights and Wake Of The Room shall be null and void in his case, should they be requested. Food and spiritual sustenance to be provided by the Town Hall. The plans for a small welcome celebration, in order to showcase the hospitality of our valley, are being finalised, with funds coming from the Mayor's personal finances. 

Feburary 9th

	I was in my tent carving stakes when I heard the trumpet; one can never be too careful, as Baden once told me. It had sounded as if it was right outside, though stepping into the open air I realised it came from far off, right across the valley in the crumpled lee of one of the mountains, ricocheting off my surroundings on the clearest morning in days. The gates were being opened. 
	They were large and cast in iron inexpertly, bubbles and fissures erupting over the strange cuneiform that was carved into them. I was greeted by a cavalcade of what I assumed to be dignitaries; I eventually realised, in hallooing them, that they were merely well-wishers and the curious, ordinary folk; yet more rubes. I packed up my tent under their watchful eyes, enduring their questions about the eyeholes in the tent sheet and the Hellenist script stitched into the lining, and crossed with them into the town. I found myself on a long dirt road lined with small homes, leading towards the haze of what I assumed to be the city itself. Long brown pennants hung on flagpoles, like those that myself and the children hung to greet Lancelot in Lyonesse, though they were far smaller and hung limply like elderly coughs in the frigid stillness. The people were dirty and silent, then, as if they were smuggling me in, and I wondering briefly if this is what was happening. I began to fret that this was not the right town, that I had stumbled on some Hyperborean refuge sheltered from civilisation and proper breeding. There was no fanfare, no crowds; even the curiosity of the rubes had waned. In the bright sparkling horror of that morning I do remember seeing something remarkable; in a small copse to the side of the road, almost obscured by the trees, another of the great “Mother Kilns” could be seen, with the thrusting member, smoke pouring from her breast-holes. Behind her, like ducklings, were several smaller stoves, perhaps the size of kennels, into which people dressed in blue tunics stuffed some sort of fish, turning to watch me as I passed. I smelt halibut, but the specimen had been long-raked, red with a scissoring beak. 
	Our group passed along the road until we reached greasy cobbles that looked like un-yeasted rolls. This rude civilisation seemed to put a glamour on my party, and they dashed in all directions, calling to me. I set off after them, stumbling past dwarf firs and beds of wild sage with my pack swinging, and rounded the corner of a watchtower into what appeared to be a very facile likeness of the Palatine Hill. A paved square of granite looked over by buildings of an almost Teutonic regularity. They were more like slabs of base stuff, not hollow at all, but rather solid blocks that pretended to be inhabited. I could see no obvious apertures on any of them. Around the square were huge, glass fishbowls set on lampposts, though they were empty of motion or colour. There was a middling crowd in the centre of the plaza, nothing like those that I greeted me at Lhasa or Machu or Mag Mell, but it seemed that I was wanted, after all. The crowd parted for me, and in its centre there stood a tiny Buddha of a man, a grinning wattle that I was to learn was named Star Watching At Sea, and who through some despotic, gangrenous process had become Mayor. After he had greeted me in a rather discourteous tone, he hurried and shooed his people aside to reveal tables laden with jellies, products of pork, and other hardy fare. Then there came music, dancing, more music, wreaths of herbs and garlic and strange lightning-shaped tassels thrown about me; I had seen it before, everywhere I went. This pathetic god-posturing, the scraping of pride, the jizz-like pomade in every hairstyle. At least the kappas had eaten fruit, scurvy still haunted me at night with lecherous little prods. I was asked to speak, briefly, behind a lectern made of one old oak trunk, and was given a bare wire that ran through the crowd like a trail through woods into the bare flank of one of the buildings. Luckily, my week-long solitude had given in to writing, and I read my poe with great solemnity, though their primitive personal address system shocked my teeth and rattled the thin walls of the speaker-house so badly that I felt that my bowel would pop.  I shook the hands of many women and girls, including the thin one I had given the leopard seal jerky to after she had climbed the gatepost and let her legs out to the sun, singing. She was held on the shoulder by her father. I touched a great, golden key, held out to me in utter silence, and the town broke into applause. I do not know what it is for. 
	An orchestra seemed to materialise out of nowhere, thirty of them or so, the crowd filled with waistcoats and ruffs, cravats fluffed and primmed like inflated mating sacs on Asian birds. After they had greeted me they waved bashfully to their stern wives, half of them lamed by milk leg. They were all quite drunk, and sheltered a menagerie of instruments both strange and familiar; the mandolin sat next to harps twenty feet tall, plucked with long hooks, and men who stroked their hands as if comforting the most fragile songbird, rubbing them against the elderly, marbled fat striated through their cheeks.. I asked them several times if I could record one of their songs and take some photographs, and after some confusion I produced my Lavalier box and my camera. As they crowded at the invisible line they had drawn between themselves and the technology, the thin girl’s father wandered over, and gruffly stated his name as Death in Strange Light. He implied quite plainly, almost immediately, that I was considered beneath him, and should name him Mr. Light when in public. His daughter followed him at heel, and stated that her name was Death of a Friend, before her father silenced her with a finger. He asked me what the devices were, and I explained, trying to stay clear of religious imagery or witch-speak. Finally, he agreed that I could record one song and take six photographs, and so I chose wisely as I was steadily introduced to the town’s inhabitants. Death of a Friend spent much of her time close by, when her father was not watching, and quietly told me that I was to lodge in the same building as her, a few floors below, where a man had died the previous year. She is plainer up close, but still pretty, and I like that she washes her hair to the point of needing a combover; cleanliness seems an idiosyncracy in this community of beet-wind and long, mournful belches. The valley is, I will admit, very beautiful; it has no obvious magic, or ruin of grandeur, but the town nestles into its lee appropriately, and in a funny way it reminds me of Asphodel; clean, bright, where souls chase each other through quiet streets. I asked the Mayor if there existed a map of the town that I might study; he told me that he would fetch me one from his personal collection from which to take notes. I can feel the heat of Mr. Light's glare upon me constantly, as if he expects me to stab his friends before him, or explode into shards of metal. The ruddy, dim-witted children kept tugging at my mask; I had to bat them away with as much force as I dared.
	After the celebrations the whole town trailed behind me as I was led on a tour. I swiftly grew tired; the air here is close and humid, hemmed in by the contours around us, and my legs were stiff after my week-long meditation. The well-wishers began to disappear home to dreams of electricity and the wall, and soon a compact bolus of entourage, including the sweating Mr. Lights and his daughter, was making its way through conifer groves to the tree-line. The path here was sculpted into the rock in scalloped steps; how odd that it should smell so like a sewer up in the clean air! We began to pass eyelets in the rock, tiny, drilled holes that were widened by the rain’s fingering, and the smell grew a source; I attempted to look within them, but some poured creamed, rancid smoke in pillars, and from others the smell of excrement was so strong that I nearly fell to my death on more than one occasion. The mayor, tied to the man behind by means of a thick rope, swallowed his catarrh and said plainly that we were passing their least holy shrines. I did not know what to say to this, and instead looked out, down again to the dark, evergreen groves. In amongst them, in the dying light, I could see deep holes in the knots of root at their base, wide warrens around which was splashed colourful paint as if by children, and more of those odd little lightning strips, tied down against an illusory wind. I pointed to them, but the mayor merely shook his head, and ushered me on. The mountains are unbroken and high around the whole valley, and disappear into the blue screen of distance. There is one mountain that seems sculpted from iron filings, it is so whipped and uninviting. It towers over everything else, and I see it is too high for even water vapour or ice to settle on its climes. The Mayor calls it the “north” Mountain, though perhaps this is a nickname, as it seems to lie to the east of the town by the sunset’s reckoning. 
	We eventually came to a little caldera, and those behind the mayor gratefully shut their eyes for a few minutes and spoke of dinner and work as I surveyed all that I could see. I will try to commit as much to a drawn map as possible, for it is much larger than I thought at first. The town is laid out in both irregular and regular angles, with some streets wide and Roman, while others evoke a old Balkan city, with redoubts, doublings back, the twist of alleys and gardens; all of the roofs are coloured teal, or cerulean, or other colours that resemble the human eye from space. There is a vast forest, broken with minuscule clearings, over to the west, and then it was lit in such a way that it was unspeakable. Though the distance made it hard to judge, it may be even larger than the town itself. I remember now, some days later, the smell, over everything. There was a mix of smoke in the air; from wood from meat, from peat and rock, they rubbed together like fuel at altitude.
	We took so many paths I cannot remember how we returned; I had seen the hint of the burial-place, ritual or common, and we trod the boardwalk of new wood by the river; how I marvelled at the icebergs, some as large as cottages, wedged resolutely in the stream itself! The ambient heat made such saurians, such elemental things, seem impossible and the stuff of dreams. I was shown the gates of the town zoo, locked up and quite pathetic, and the slender, cosmopolitan profile of the First Loss (a lodging of some luxury where, oddly, I am not staying), and finally to my lodgings. The building is tall and wooden, surrounded by identical brothers in a pattern like buttons on a typewriter; canals diverted from the river flow between them, crossed by tiny, humped bridges. I write this on my bunk; the walls are Spartan, and alien with a waxy fish oil used as varnish. I have posted my effects around me, but not even Bismark’s Tooth can lift this strangeness, and such is its only real use. I feel something that I have not felt in a long while. There is a great warmth that seems to surround the building even at night, and a gushing of drains or the river; oddly, it seems to come from above me. 
	The Mayor and his council bid me goodnight at the door, and Death of a Friend and her father led me to my room. Indeed, they live a few floors above me, though there is a staircase that winds all the way up to my floor, around the outside of the building, like scaffolding on an abbey. 

Reminder – I must try and see inside this silent, foreboding hotel; perhaps renovations are being undertaken, and as such I am billeted here amongst locals. However, my impression is that the town does not receive enough visitors for such a building to make enough gold or gems or paper or stone or whatever they use to barter here; it’s as splendid as the Stanley before that little goblin Bachman ruined everything. I hope that they can exchange my molars; I have held onto them too long. But what use has a secret such as this place for currency?

The journal is bound in black fabric, and is comprised of loose-sheafed, off-white paper. It is covered in dirt, scratches, burns and dents, and on its back cover is seen the Widsith Institute’s logo once more. On the front are three pieces of punctuation, picked out in Imperial, gilded lettering; an exclamation mark, a question mark and a full stop. Upon opening it, the contents is as listed below, but on the inside front cover is seen, in spidered, indistinct handwriting, a short message, which reads: “To (Name Obscured), Merry Christmas, Love From (Name Obscured).”</Text>

            <Text>Diagram Of The Apartment Building

In the journal the reader will find several pages sliced through and cut to show a three-dimensional floor plan of an apartment building, starting with the basement and working its way up to the top floor. 

The Basement - A square room with a small entryway. The legend reads: The mushroom cellar. Along with beetroot it is the primary crop of this place. I am told that there are great courts of stilton-blue fungi deep below the mountains, sleeping like gitwerc. The smell is unbearable; someone, I think, has neglected the harvest. There are scurrying rodents with long arms, like gorillas, that reach up to nibble at the caps. They are all albine, and blind.

The First Floor - A triangular room with two smaller rooms off it. The legend reads, for the three rooms: 

- The entrance hall. There is a large censer here, and a warden who perpetually sleeps and scratches hidden boils that the fumes must cause. There is kindred in the colour. 
- A communal bathroom; I was surprised on my first morning by Mr. Light’s hair-peppered torso. 
- Someone lives here; they receive post, at least, and groceries. 

The Second Floor - a spiralling corridor. The legend reads: There is at the centre here, though to where I do not know; no-one but myself will acknowledge it. It is silent here, alone. There are lights in the wall, inside the fabric of it, and I do not know there source. The silence. 

The Third Floor - Four rooms in each other four corners. The legend for each room reads:

- ?
- My room.  
- The rooms of the two K!K!K! Players. There is much shuffling and moaning at night, but I do not think that they are lovers. 

The Fourth Floor - A large room with a smaller one in the corner of the building. The two legends read:

- The Recreation Room. A large stove, chairs and wide stones - a meeting place like any other. Stories are told, sung, played. People do not talk to me. It is the way here. 
- A small room - perhaps where Kicking Sods Into Sea lives? He seems to materialise at will, mostly at mealtimes or when alcohol, usually onion wine, is offered. 

The Fifth Floor - Two rooms and a single room on either side of a long river. The legends for the river, and then the rooms, read:

- The river runs across the middle of this floor. I cannot explain it. Friend and I sit here, eating strawberries and looking for fish sucked up in the workings of the pumps. 
- This door is always locked, and a great heat emanates through its imperfections. 
- I think that the solemn man and his daughter live here. I have never seen them arrive or leave, but there are two pairs of galoshes, always wet, one large and one small, outside the door on racks. 
- Mr. Lights’ and Friend’s room. So small for the two of them!

The Roof - A drawing of a fantastical beast, half-lizard and half-bird. The legend reads: The Roof Garden. The trapdoor here is locked, but at night and when I leave the building I hear a pained braying. Whatever is up there sounds in pain, and must never leave its perch; from the mountains it is too misty to see what cockatrice they keep, for meat or for milk. Everyone denies hearing anything, even when it shakes the wood under their feet. </Text>

            <Title>10 Recipes</Title>
            <Synopsis>An extract from a recipe book.</Synopsis>
            <Text>April 1st

	I visited the kitchen of a famous chef today. She may be the worst chef I have ever met. I believe these recipes were what caused the only real sickness I have had in all my time in Loss. They were a special, darling sort of disgusting – the musk of eggs and rollmops in milk rolled downhill in rusty barrels previously used to store the knotted viscera of Timur’s conquests. Cat Caught In Griddle is very old, and very small, and seems to have a point about herself where gravity collects, a dint in some hidden magnet. She gathers there, and apparently was once very beautiful. I cannot see the genealogy of such beauty. She keeps a great, round room in the First Loss, the only one that is occupied, high in the penthouse from which she winches meals down to the field children who wait there like cats. There are no lifts, and I blinked rubber-sweat from my lashes as I loped up to Room E967. The interior of this scimitared profile is a familiar bastion of panelled wood and long, low rooms with no furniture; Friend says that it has all been used for scaffolding. Before I ascended I noted that above the reception desk, unmanned and covered in tarpaulin, was a portrait; the man posing, though it was impossible, was Abraham Lincoln, shaking hands with someone beyond the frame. His clothes were different, much smoother, dyed and whorled, and like something a mage or warlock would wear. He wore a wide smile, and looked around thirty or forty. It couldn't have been him, but there is still a nagging doubt in the pit of my stomach.
I was told that Cat Caught likes sweet tastes, and light fragrances, and so I bought her gifts from the odd confectioners in the old town; there are a pair of them, Weak And Goud’s, and apparently it is a most venerable law that customers cannot shop in one alone, but must spend money in both. I brought her beet-toffees from one and a black liquid, sealed in a clear bag, from the other. They have great signs shaped like war-arrows that point to their competitor, inviting people to enter, and placards that change daily, singing the praises of their partner in balladic tones. A very odd edict.
	Her quarters occupy the entire top floor of the hotel, and from under the door infiltrated a base, churned odour, a smell of sex. She answered the door, and did not greet me, or shake my hand, but merely beckoned me inside. My first impression was that there seemed to be little food in the old woman's home, though the apartment was dominated by the largest Mother Kiln I had ever seen, larger even than the canteen-denizens of the worker’s huts, gross with furred grease, a bronze tongue lapping from her dot of a mouth. I was close enough to examine the protuberance at the base of the Kiln; the hands of the relief were moulded into grasps, and they were in position at each side of the tap, as  I realised it was. I was under no illusion anymore; this mother was a war-father, an angry ravisher, and her proud member defied all those who, like myself, proscribed gender upon her. She told me, opening her mouth for the first time, that she was only living here until her husband came home. I wondered how they transported the kiln up here - there is no dust around its base, and there are handprints in the patina.
	The old cook took bowls from a rack above the kiln and put them under the tap;  a soupy fluid, tiny elements suspended in each drip, percolated down. I realised that the meat that they cooked in these ovens for days at a time were merely like the shells of acorns, syrupy amphora for fat. This was boiled out and collected in some hidden reservoir, to be used as soup, as stock, as cooking oil; every dish she told me of used it in some way. Fat is important to them, a practical ubiquity and a social lubricant in the very literal sense. She cooked me lye balls for lunch, taking great scoops of fat down from wood tubs and throwing them into a glowing pan. There was some insult of gods. She cooks a separate dish for her statue of a god of premature ejaculation, and then takes it behind a screen, and re-emerges some minutes later, re-arranging her smock and mixing it with a willow-stick. I am used to such behaviour by now. She gave me a bowl which I dug into a small map of residential district to simulate eating. When I left she forced me to take it home, though I threw it into the river as soon as I could, where perhaps it formed the basis of a nightmare-tradition for crustaceans. The smell was in my mask for days. I longed to hang it out my window. 

I stole these from her cookbook to feed my worst enemies and their children and the grandchildren of their children.

(The following is presented on torn notebook pages, in a hand very small and neat. The pages are splattered with food). 

Oh Carbonate! Oh Carbonate!

- No socks or shoes
- Cat gut (To The C-Word!)
- Ice, Crushed, Assorted Flavours
- Rye (15 husks)

Place the rye in your pocket least-used, put on your no-socks before your no-shoes, the ice must be placed in a bag at your brow, and on the gut pluck out the song of the Now.

Guests should be seated at this point.

First Course

LYE BALLS

For twelve guests.

10 Onions, Field Or Cave
12 Radishes
10 Beet
15 Scatterbird Fillets, Or 1 Abbot Breast (Diced)
12 Quarts Of One’s Own Fat, Or From A Lover’s Middle (Reduced To Silkiness)
6 Pinches Of Paprika
Various Rock Salts
Brandy
Springwater
Cow Cream (An Unholy Jugful)

Breast fat, especially from sad girls, is probably the best – a three month diet of liver and courgette flowers will produce the silkiest lipid. The arms of a Slender Man, plucked fresh and exorcised, is a worthy substitute in the summer months when bulk is nowhere to be found.  The scatterbird dicings should be sliced, drowned in whiskey, and then boiled for three months to reduce to a golden syrup. 
Fry the onions, beetroot, and radish, mix in the cream and springwater to a jealous paste, and introduce the brandy and rock salts. Pour on the hot fat and set before moulding into balls and finishing in the oven. Serve on fluted plates facing West. The paprika is for your own tongue.

Second Course

ECLIPSE PIE

A summer dish.
Use as much of each ingredient as you can find.

Pastry
Flour
Butter
Water
Milk
Shortening

Filling

Marmoset (A Whole Pack, To Reduce Distress)
Doggerel
Hound (Any Kind)
Goblin Whale
Warhound (To Be Stored Separately From Other Hounds To Reduce Spoilage And Massacre)
Spices And Herbs Pertaining To Your Family History
Cages, Thick Bars, Strong, Assorted

Mix the pastry and spread, as a base, from the West To The West, throughout the whole valley. Build up the walls, using palisades if necessary, and finally place the lid with great ceremony, remembering to pierce air-holes as one goes. The crimps should hug the tree-line all around the town. The meat, still living, should be rubbed with the herb mix using brooms and mops and kept in secure cages.  The temperature will be high enough after two months, and the meat ready to eat after four months. Divide the dish by family, or dynasty. The glacier will store any leftovers for at least a century.

Third Course

THE APOCALYPSE CHAMBER

An allegory of the End Times, created in the heart of an ox. 

The ox must be old, and melancholy; four days in a cellar will help this. A lack of sunlight is vital; ultraviolets will broil the dish beyond repair. Feed the ox for three weeks on sugar, marrow syrup, melted butter and sibilant jelly.  The animal may well die; if not, slaughter it and speak for it and embrace it for a week. Cut it in half, and remove the veins and capillaries, laying them out separately and ordered, though still attached to the heart. Now the kneading must begin. This can take a further two weeks, less with help; one must begin with the capillaries and their fronds, moulding the contents back towards the heart. A good technique is necessary, otherwise the mix will separate and be absorbed. As the capillaries empty, rub the tertiary, then the secondary, and the primary veins until the arteries closest to the heart are full to dripping. The heart must then be packed to capacity. After this, pluck the heart from the now-desiccated network. The heart should  be oiled, wrapped in grease-paper, packed with soil and submerged in water for a further week. Serve the heart to no more than four people, with tree-sap to dip. It should never be served to foreigners, for fear of their own heart’s finding too much peace in the allegory. 

After dinner, a trek to the Feeble Zeniths, along with processions of trumpeting, costumes and sweet dill, has been proven to aid digestion and memory.

His Highness Peter Parley

(Here is found a rough approximation of Samuel Griswold Goodrich)

THIS MUST BE BY WRIT

THE HIDDEN PRESS

IN HISTORY COMMISSIONED BY MOST UNHOLY WHISPER
IN THE YEAR THAT WE ARRIVED IN THE HOME FOR HATRED AND HE DEPARTED FROM US IN A COLUMN OF STEAM, HOOTING. 

BEING THE FIRST AND ONLY BOOK OF ALL BOOKS, THAT BEING ALL NECESSARY, WITH ONLY ONE PROPHECY, THE FIRST PROPHECY AND THE ONLY ONE THAT, IN THE END, PERHAPS MATTERS

THE VERSE BEGINS. WE DIE ETERNALLY SO THAT THE GODS MAY NOT HAVE US.

For MAN was perverted.
For MAN was sacred. 
For MAN was gross.
For MAN sired mothers.

When the beginning was merely a poem in the tonsils of man-augurs there was MAN. We dove sonorous, and rose gracious. Our eyes rollocked with the plains-factory of pulleys the might of mountains, and these pulleys winched light into pupils the un-size of black holes.

Time was thrown backward at each step, and so we was still. 

And we was the colour of a wall of none, and quasars formed when we rubbed against our brothers on those few occasions when we shook hands. 

We had warts, and we call these suns after the love we felt. 

And our brain was a deep-precinct, a complex of thousands of markets of blinking gas-civilisations. Here life was. And in this life there was worry, and in that worry perfection fell. And so MAN was betrayed by himself. 

And so MAN did betray himself, and doubt that which he had made. We wished to rest, and though we rested we found no time to rest again.

We wished friends that were not like us. 

We wished MAN to have his equals.

Oh, how great we were, how kind and humble. 

Hear our warning, and the tearing of vacuum as we weep.

And so it happened, hear this, it happened, that half of MAN tore off their tails, the seat of them, and hurled them into the void, and these tails became the gods, and they were fatty and small, with the nugget of gristle that we bear in the commonest of sewers. 

This is what others called them, bringing them to the level of the most underdeveloped node in the mind of the Great Retard. We call them, instead, (the following long word is crossed out, seemingly in the original text).

Here WHISPER joins us. 

He is not WHISPER.

He was merely one of us then, and in him was such a reactor.

And so it was that he called the gods poor in spirit and wealth, and named them enemy. But he would not be heeded. 

Hear our warning, and the slapping of our backs as we weep.

But the gods were fatty and small, and many, and dark against the dark of night. And with no warning war was made, and stars winked out, and the crown was stolen. 

The Abdication was short, and the crown was black and now it is white in their small hands, bleached by spoilage and the dying of us. 

And so it was that the gods murdered us. Their chatter was reason and it stung us. Their barbs were small but they grew colonies in our innards and our atoms and waged war there. 

And those Long Men who had given their tails threw ourselves at the void; we grew our hair long and wore chains spun with bulging novae around our chests. We would now die. We would now birth the next line of man; though they were webby and red with stuff when they were birthed. We were disgusted. We were disgusting

Hear our warning, and the death of us as we weep. 

And thus we were murdered, and our blood fell as fire and water to the new earth and the new moon, and scarred them and turned them liquid. The moon now sulks, barely a child, and not yet a man, nursing his wounds that will heal. Man bless the Teenage Moon and his moods.

And so MAN fled to this Earth, and shrunk himself to wedge into the caverns and calderas that now were the ground. The fire moved in rivers  and MAN squabbled in his new, childish form, giving us death and the fear of death. 

We began to die, and reason made it so.

We will miss the MAN, for we are too poor to be named so. We are only man.

And then so it was that WHISPER joined us, disguised and small amongst his people. And he gathered those of us he loved (for he loved not everyone, and hated many) and led them to a ring of fire that spat and died; and from this fire and WHISPER'S deep breath a mountain formed, and another, and another, and like battlements they grew and hid us. The gods amused themselves tossing their new ash-crown fro head to head, and the shadow hid us at last.

And so he told us this story, that we may read it to our young. 

And so he built us houses that we may be closer to home.

And so he taught us lies that our speech may hide us. 

And so he taught us sport that we may be the past still and walk as far as we may.

And he made us statues of the oldest phlegm behind our pendulum that we may blow smoke into their faces, when we have cleared our throats.

And so he taught us language that we may shout inside it.

And so the white crown sees the land and all it has made, and yet it does not see us.

May the white be black again. 

May man be MAN. 

May we have our throne back. 

May the gods fail their lovers and be lonely. 

May outsiders be damned. 

May man be MAN. 

May we never be friends with the world, or those in it, and may they never harm us. 

Hear our warning, and the tearing of vacuum as we weep.

            <Title>13 Diary Entry 2</Title>
            <Synopsis>A diary entry relating to an exploration of the town. </Synopsis>
            <Text>March 2nd

	Friend has spent much of the last month with me; it is a rare day that I do not see her. The girl is pleasing to sit with; she does not ask me many questions of the outside world, and is content to tell me what she knows of her town and her home. However, though she is lovely to look at she is quite stupid, and what she knows is very little. Perhaps it is just that she is young. She tells me that she is three hundred, and is prone to laughter followed by murmuring storm fronts of anger that seem to last for true aeons, over the most trivial things – a stubbed toe, myself letting a door shut behind me before she has followed.
	We spend hours on the fourth floor river. I once stepped into the stream to investigate the hatch from which the water pours – I know that the river, nameless and a trickle as it enters the canals of the residential district, flows into the building at ground level; a great roar is heard at the cistern, and the sound of cogs and gears, and then this, a lazy brook that meanders across the high floor of the flat. The wood beneath my feet was varnished and pitted with purple algae that sprouted heads of water broccoli. Someone has planted chicory in long rows, and Friend lets her pet rodent, a mouse-like thing that materialises every few days, scurry about the raised beds, nibbling. She seems to wear the same clothes everyday, yet they remain so clean! A green slip, tied with Long Men Tails, jagged so that they press into the little hump of her stomach. I imagine they leave little divots like the feet of robins. I should like scratch them in that way that make her toes crinkle. It is quite odd to think of the uses that these makeshift genitals have; they adorn the waists of girls, the thresholds of shops, and the nets of the fishermen. I have yet to unravel the rather odd relationship the town has with the “Long Men”; that is to say, as my research has shown me, women. 
	She is small, and I imagine we look quite comical, strolling through town, a golem and his slender rabbi. Her eyes are very, very dark and she has a broad face, a face made for tattoos or scarification, and she has hair on her forearms, the sign of true beauty. Her teeth are bad, and she hides them, scowling usually, a twitch in her lip pulsating. Her breasts already have some of the hang that they could keep for the rest of her days, and my attempts at lust have a flavour of maintenance about them; I aim to provide lift. She grows her nails long and tries to hide smiles when she breaks them. I think she likes the noise they make. 
	We went to meet her father at work the other day; the graveyard is past the Old Town and is burrowed into its own patch of wilderness, past a fence tied with Long Men's Tails and wildgrass between two homes that are connected by a bridge of overhead rungs at the height of the second floor. On the dusty path we passed small yurts, wreaths of smoke coming from them; naked men emerged periodically and ran into the woods, yelling. My questions went unanswered; she is too young to know what they do. Friend tells me that these parts are the home of huge, venomous spiders that wreak terrible havoc on the colonies of mice that burrow under the tree bark. I have never seen them. Someone had hung salmon, dried and many years old, in the branches of some of the larger trees. I smell carrot, rich and almost radioactive in its intensity, and I know that it is wild and black.
	We reached a set of simple gates, created from ancient pollards that had grown into thick barriers. A rope hung there, tied with a stone for weight, and as we pulled it the gate rose, clicking and chirruping its way into notches cut to hold it. The path is cobbled here, the grass spongey and lush in that way that points to frequent digging. The graveyard is a deep hollow cut into the valley floor many years before, and part of the mountain that rears above it. How the townspeople made such a depression without heavy machinery is beyond me; but I am learning not to question everything that I see here. I have plenty of time to find where they keep the trebuchets and cranes. 
	Friend's father was eating bacon by the rasher in his hut. A dirty spade rested against him, clanging as his leg jumped to some interior beat. 
	The graveyard has as much of a deliberate topography as the residential district; some of the steles and tombs rise many storeys, crowned with dioramas of winged men, women gripping swords, and gods with minuscule genitalia. The writing on them, both the Tachygraph and Latinate script, were many feet high, and whirled and dipped into each other like a debate between simpletons. Here is a great geometric legacy, one which I cannot interpret. The only words that make any sense to me are “bard” and “cough”, repeated at several key structural points in these tholos-grounds.  
	A huge, reclining man is carved in a single piece basalt near the centre of the compound, leaning into a crouch as if he is about to spring at the mountain, to tackle it back below ground. Deep in his perineum is the tell-tale piebalding of many hands thrust in superstition, and embossed letters spell out CHERNOBOG. Mr. Light barked at me not to wander, as it was not right that I should even be in such a place. Through the morning fog I could see terraces rising up the mountain, obelisks and crypts widening into great complexes, much like at Karnak or Thebes; however, here and there wild hares ranged between the plots, and the grass is lush and thick. There was a sweet smell on Mr. Lights breath, and all around me. He had hung rows of phylacteries, white and black, on copper railings around his hut, and I finally asked what they were for. He looked at me with something approximating acceptance, perhaps for the only time in our acquaintance, and told me that some people take a pinch of the grave dirt with them after they have buried their dead; it is worn on the arm or the forehead, and consulted for key decisions and celebrations. This really leaves me none the wiser, though the perceived importance of his task is clearly what buoys him up; he seems like a man that could sag at any moment. I told him of the Jews having a similar practice, and he looked quizzical and nervous, as if he had been told that the meat he ate at dinner was human flesh. Friend finished talking to her father, and, quite amazingly, they shook hands; queerer and queerer! As we left I asked her why she had done what she had done; she took my hand, then, for the first time, and told me that she had said goodbye. She was treating me like an idiot. I asked her if she kissed her father, or if he kissed her, and she slapped me lightly on the shoulder, as far up as she could reach, and dragged me back towards town, where we bought strange meat. I asked her if she knew what a kiss was. 

There are a number of scratchings of figures and equations, and a mysterious chemical diagrams, showing bonds, valencies, elements and constant calendars of time passed and time still to pass. The scratchings are desperate and panicked. From this point on in the diary they begin to appear in the margins of entries, on the backs of maps and drawings, and inside the suitcase.

            <Synopsis>A study of the native tongue. </Synopsis>
            <Text>April 6th

As far as I can glean from the texts that I have read,  the ceremonial tongue of Loss, which has no name (but for definition's sake will be called the Tachygraph), is one of the most brusque and yet expressive linguistics systems I have ever come across. It is quite different from the whale song of Ys, or the windy cancer-chatter of the Golden Temple. There is no waifness, no lightness of carriage across the tongue. There are better halloos across the kingdoms; the spriggan were much fairer in speech than the dour folk I now co-habit with, especially when talking of their lower halves or war. But, as a language, the Tachygraph has its higher uses, especially in festival; the people of Loss usually speak excellent English, with a complete absence of accent. I had expected some shallow gutter tongue, designed for smaller lungs and cross-bred larynx (it is now evident to me that these people generally keep their morning-star close to the gauntlet, as it were; the most backward of them can barely breathe, yet are gifted tall, stately homes along the river from which the bellow and drip piss on passersby). In one of my interviews with the Mayor I asked him how the people of the valley came to use English as its tongue; were it not for the surroundings we could be in the hawthorn and cricket brush of Surrey. He waved the query away with an arachnoid digit, nearly catching my gas filter with his too-sharp nails, reciting this poem out onto his courtyard lawn where his son was playing with a curious instrument that whirled and spun:

One tongue, one tongue, one tongue, one tongue, one tongue, one tongue, one tongue, one tongue!
Whisper brings us invisible ghosts to hold.
One tongue, one tongue, sky-rung, one tongue, one tongue, sky-rung, one tongue, one tongue!
That teach us to speak like maggots on mold
Teach gash to speak. 
Our lips are our wounds
And our teeth the larvae.
We open the stitches 
And out comes the marvels. 

	Again, lies, misdirection, appalling verse, and glowering, spoilt silence.  The basic roots of it all obviously reside in their absurd cosmology, though I have had no chance to discover how far their mistrust and evasiveness goes. The Mayor, of himself, is a liar, but a pleasant one, a fellow bibliophile and artisan – out there, beyond the elm windowpane and creamy glass he has had a small oak cloven in two in his garden, creating a space large enough for a small person. He constantly threatens his son that he will shut him up in there until his twentieth birthday; he makes for a fat Ariel, though. When I ask him of Death's father, he smiles before a gross melancholic sets in, and he starts to tap at the doors, the doors that lead to the organs of his life, his quarters and the bedroom of his son and missing wife. 
	It seems that though English is their communication, with little to distinguish it in its usage, the Tachygraph is really all their own. The letter pattern is very limited. In any other place I would have said that they were too few, that no true understanding could have originated from such a bare tree. But this is Loss, and I am loath to attempt science when there is an air of confoundment that hangs around me like gas. 
	This research comes from the Mayor's library, larger than that of the town, though I returned the books before they were missed. Unlike English, or many other Latinate languages, the Tachygraph does not have names for the letters themselves; the people of Loss find spelling very difficult, almost an existential crisis; for them, letters exist on their own, and cannot possibly be described using other letters. I am inclined to see their point of view. 

(These symbols are set out almost like illuminated manuscripts; they only slightly resemble the symbols used here to represent them).

!
This, on its own, denotes surprise, beginnings, birth, sexual intercourse, art, farming and lightning, amongst other things. It seems to be considered something of a Prime Letter, if any such thing exists. Katyayana would have been almightily pleased that his theories were in practice somewhere in or of the world.

?
The letter above represents confectionery, the Universe, debate,  grief, etc. It is often used with the letter above to denote importance or confusion, and is, on its own, a malaprop; its use comes from the similarity, in sound, to an alingual cry of grief. As if acquiescing to such a tradition, I can be similar to the “eheu” or “ahem” in usage; an elemental expression, the scream or the grunt of a flood victim. 

.
This is used for apocalypse, insects, crime, death and children. Often people describe this symbol as “lonely”, and I have seen it drilled into manhole covers, on the rear walls of public buildings. 

K 
This is used for departure, athletics, war, festivals and technology. Often written in rapid succession, such as in the game K!K!K!; the most extensive use I have found is the term to describe heterosexual marriage, which, amongst other letters, has 26 of these in its structure. Death of a Friend tells me that marriage is often avoided to avoid having to use this word at the ceremony, though I don't believe her. 

*
I insisted on calling this “the star” for several weeks, much to the chagrin of the townspeople. The worst reaction was from Hammer And Black Thumb, the dentist. He seemed to have a special fondness for the letter, calling me an “iconoclast”, amongst worse things. It is used for official documents, medical matters, the sea, mythology and gods. The mayor’s ring is carved with one.  

()
These are actually a pair of letters, though I have never seen one used without the other. Obviously, these are used to represent twins, duality, pairs or opposites, though their meaning is more complex than this. They can also mean loneliness (though I am told that it is a different kind of loneliness from that represented by the other symbol), singularity, or footwear, tumours or illness in general, or port duties and tax. The sole of every shoe has them cut into the grip. They appear to me like a mouth, kissing the earth.

A 
(This letter’s appearance is irrelevant - it is crossed through many times).
This is the “ohm” of the Tachygraph. I have seen it afforded no prime status but I believe it to be the most holy symbol of the Tachygraph – it is used extremely rarely, and with the same reverence that the transubstantiationalists place in wine and polythene. My only real encounter with this letter, and its use, came when I was helping the cinema workers reel in their screen from the river, keeping it clear of the icebergs; they were singing as they dragged, in long, single vowels repeated. When I then merely deigned to ask them what they were singing, they began laughing and slapping me about the back and shoulders, while I tried to help them! I immediately dropped my corner of the screen and left to recline under a nearby willow.  One of them came to join me, ruffled my hair and grimly stamped on a large beetle, a Pageant Weevil and full of deadly venom. He picked a small fern (see below)  that he told me would help if I ever was stung. I asked if it was to be ingested or used as a poultice, and he told me that in fact when ingested it is indeed more poisonous, and will hasten inevitable death. 
	After silence as we gazed on the setting sun try to glow through the miles of mountain rock, he said that he and his friends had been singing for their dinner. Many workers forgo meals for two or three days at a time, voluntarily, in order to keep their minds strong and focussed. When they did eat, he stated, their food was sacred to them, a reward and a fleeting pleasure that was not to be repeated for some time. The only way that he could render the practice in English was as the phrase “the meal that comes as if a great wind had smeared it over my lips”. He drew the letter for me, and sung it again, alone, though his fellows looked up and grinned when they heard him. It seems to represent finality, the termination of things, the close of day, or torture, derision or greed. I was at the time unaware of the valley's aversion to traditional worship, and asked if the phrase “manna from Heaven” came close. He lifted his foot, scraped the insect from the ground, and threw it at me, before turning to leave. I was quite startled, and flicked it with as much grace as I could into the alpine water. 

	There is not only a ritual aspect to the Tachygraph, but a quotidian necessity that I have discovered. Some of the letters are used everyday, in labyrinthine structures of tongue-work that form separate universes of un-faith for the speaker. There are warbles as stoves are prepared for breakfast, mumblings from between the ancient, cracked dice that the stooped gamblers hold in their mouths, by the orchestra (who seem unemployed for much of the year) speaking soothingly to the brass prows of their huge instruments. 
	Some are meaningless or insulting when spoken alone, and one or two are reserved for official business and are rarely spoken by the populace at large.  And yet there are so few! The rules as to their usage and nuances of meaning seem endless, and I doubt I shall ever understand them all. I befriended a group of nervous students on lunch-break from classes; they occasionally go for bone marrow at the butchers, or to scratch themselves under trees and sleep. Their uniforms are hair-shirts, long and cumbersome; I asked them about it as they shifted and itched in the heat, and they told me that the teachers make them wear them to promote distraction; in Loss, this is a key educational tool. I imagine that the poor creatures will think of anything else other than their discomfort, and perhaps this is where genius strikes, in the red skin and endless, rustling fabric.                         
	I asked one of them, saving the pips from his apple to flick at his friends,whether it would be appropriate for me to attempt to write a poem in the Tachygraph. He told me that it is really nothing to do with him. I found this quite amusing, and he asked what I thought poetry had any business being near books at all. I went alone to the library. Spider spent most of the time peering over my shoulder, gibbering and shaking his head before disappearing to stare from a window into the sun.
	Below is my effort. The translation is my own; it felt only right that I be the one to do so. 

(The poem is presented as dual translation, with the Tachygraph on the left and the English on the right. The Tachygraph has not been reproduced here, but the lines are corrected many times, and sometimes replaced completely). 

And how the gates are genius
And how they tick-tock over our heads like Greek bingo wings
   Perfumed and with ducts 
As small as the mouths of oranges
Which are turned up
Lowing like cattle
Cooing like anuses

They handle cameras
like animals to be drowned.
I must show them
And I accidentally catch them all,
Slanted in their gateway
As if about to fall off their valley.
Their valley is perfumed, and they melt fat
And semen to grease nets.
The fish feed on tadpoles.

Her father is a hunter and fisherman.
She does not have a mother.
He fucks the Mayor
And that is how it is done.
I am living in their building
And I let my wood-smoke,
The tin and kinetics of my burner
Wind up to her,
Covered in me
Like Rapunzel,
Or Baba Yaga
I let down hair,
Steal fingers,
Rub my nakedness on the night
And hers are on my windowsill
Like flies, like flies, like flies.


	The townspeople had a meeting that evening that I was not invited to, and Friend refused to read the thing or even listen to me reading it. I retired to remove my mask, though before I did so she allowed me a rub of her outer thigh for my effort. I think she may be in love with me.

            <Text>April 15th

	Something has happened to Friend; her behaviour over the last week has become more and more erratic. We were parading on the Boardwalk today, myself taking her hand before the scandalised eyes of the basking labourers, scared to be locked indoors, and, quite without merit, as I was speaking about my theories on the pointless derma-mythologising of cartographile skin cults, she pulled her hand away, snatched my armful of books and threatened to throw them into the river if I didn't desist. It is as if she has started to hate me. She called me an “boring old elephant” without knowing what one was. I had shown her a picture once from my journals and she had shown no interest, but now she uses this to hurt me. She does not know that it is quite pointless to try. I endured the staring eyes and managed to calm her down, lightly retrieving Spider's books from her grasp, before she strode ahead, pulling the sausage I had bought her from her pinafore, where it had stained in a wide oval as if the moon was up. 
	We do not see the little girl and her father anymore; someone has shut their cubby in the entrance hall and sealed it with nails. Today at breakfast I heard the sound of heavy machinery from the other side of the building, and the walls shook and dislodged dynasties of insects like mobiles of spare legs above my head. I thought that I would finally see the Byzantine mechanics that these people hide from me, but I was waylaid by old Kicking Sods, who blocked my path with an old broom and began asking for passwords and hexes and other such nonsense. By the time I got outside there was no more noise, and no tracks in the small gardens that rim the apartment blocks; I was defeated once more, and I also saw that the missing pair's room, their entire apartment, had been ripped from the building, as smoothly as one selects eggs from a shelf. I had only seen this once before, after the funeral of an old woman from a neighbouring building a month ago; it seems that at every turn these people confound me, demolishing whatever I can build of sense. 
	My fears are constantly assuaged by those I meet; that the illnesses are nothing serious, that the people of Loss are delicate, rare, and proudly so, and that it will pass and that death is not so serious, for them, especially children; they are prepared for the next life early in years. They seem right; only two or three have died, though I worry about the little girl's father. I try to get Friend to stay away from the young, but she communes with them like a mother owl, feeding them chocolate and joining their games with no invitation or even words passed between them. But, she seems well, and even though she barely speaks to me she seems content. I can breathe without numbers, again, I think.
	I had thought their parents were preoccupied, for it seemed that they were all filthy their faces and necks black with what I thought was coal dust or soil, though there were too many, and in such a regular pattern for this to be case. had then thought that they wore their hats too tight, or that there was some pixish game being played on the fool foreigner, but more and more of them appear with it, and they do not appear to be playing games; they cough, and gaze at the ground, drooling and dragging their feet, and their knuckles are dirty though they do not work. I must plot the viral implications of such a sickness; if pathogenic, exit plan twelve seems likely best; it avoids the graveyard, and can be adapted for daylight.    
	I went to the Mayor's office to find out what had happened to my neighbours, the image of the father embossed in my head. After offering me a strong, bark-like jerky, he told me through violent chews that they had been moved down the valley for their own safety, and the safety of their immediate neighbours. His son, Book Burnt For Secrets, played with a papier-mache volcano that had been constructed for him on the floor. He is a fat, sweaty little boy, one for whom I have had a dislike for ever since the incident with the dung-heap and the ghost skeleton. The Mayor tugged at his clothing, and has now begun to sweat in symbiosis with his son, thick patches rubbing themselves into his crotch and neck. I finally summoned the courage to ask after the boy's mother, and he ejected me from his office with as much aplomb as he could muster. I was escorted to the square, where two men I had not seen before, heavily bearded and with flour dusting their flanks, stood by the Execution Venn, staring at some hidden, shared spot in its ellipsis, sharing a cheroot. The sickness, despite the authority's insistence of its mild nature, is making the townsfolk uneasy, superstitious to the point of madness. The last few days I have begun to smell something that I have only smelt twice before, once at Belsen and once in Ur; the scent of cooking meat, toffee-sweet in a way that only one animal is when burnt, and I felt the tingling of my nostrils as my allergies to ash and hot air remembered themselves and kicked. 
	I retreated to the apartment, my little knock-hole becoming more and more comforting with each passing day, and found the present I had given to Friend in its two pieces, nestled in its wrapping at my door. I brought it inside. That was at around four o'clock; it is long past dark now, and I have not eaten all day. I will write for the evening, and watch for corpse fires. If they are burning bodies, I will know. They may not talk to me, these inbred, but they cannot hide the lights of their fires at night.

1 – Short Track

A short folk song by a youth. 
See notes on back. 

Notes read I was approached by a sickly looking youth at breakfast at the Backbone Café, tall and thin with the most strikingly long fingers; he spoke with a lisp, and carried a small guitar case, or so it looked. He asked if we could go for a walk and that he wanted to talk to me. The pathetic nature of the thing made me intrigued, and we walked up into the narrow paths in the mountains, above the great waterfall to the east of the town. 

He asked me what I knew about the mythology of the town. I told him I had been allowed to read the Hidden Press, and his face had a grim, pursed look. He told me that he and a group of his friends didn't adhere to what he called “the Mayor's doctrine”; it seems that even deism is an attractive prospect for a rebelling teenager. He kept picking grass and twisting it round his finger before flinging it so that it hovered in the wind, just for a second, like Da Vinci's copter. He said that a group of them wrote songs about the gods and kept them in secret. He seemed to believe that Loss was heading for something terrible, some distant apocalypse. He would not tell me his name, but said that he would play one for me, and let me record it, if I promised never to play it to anyone from the town. He was terrified; atheism was enforced rather strictly. 

It is a middling track, and his voice is reedy and indistinct; but a folk tradition, especially here, in a place were even the status quo I have not unpicked yet, is a thrilling development; it is an evolution of a culture before my eyes. A shame that it is in the hands of such a sad, scared child.

N.B. He mentions Vladimir Propp. Perhaps the town library is not as poorly stocked as I first believed it to be? Where do they receive these shipments of books from? 



When I step out that door
Dad's an expert at semaphore
He can send me directions
At twenty-seven miles or more

And I rely on my back
It's the greatest thing I lack
I'm a coward, I'm a runt
I'm the only sheep that's black

Gods of Grace, 
Gods of Time, 
Roll your eyes.

A cabbage leaf
Placed carefully
Gives me peace.

Through the sweat that I mop
I read a book by Mr. Propp
On the inside of religion
And the common knowledge shop.

It seems others went before
With more courage and more force. 
Superstition isn't much
When you're kissing lengths of gorse

I have my staff carved with lines
That signify an absent time
I am all those boys who left
And whose fathers didn't mind

Pick me up, gods oh gods
Be my fire, be my rod
Furnish me with scripture
And give me back my virgin's blood

Gods of Grace 
Gods of Time
Roll your eyes

Potbellies
And buttered bread
Yellow on red

KEY CHANGE

Gods of Grace 
Gods of Time
Roll your eyes

Maybe then
I'll feel your gaze
That makes me ashamed.

3 – Song By Discovering Leprosy

The Farewell Song, As Related To Me By Discovering Leprosy, June 13th

The sound of setting up the camera, the crackle of a fire, a click and a whirr, low murmuring and then the clear of a throat and the song begins, a baritone (see notes for reference). The song is cut short by the sound of an old man shouting, apologies and the rapid shutting down of the machine. 

We hear a short click and whirr, the camera and recording equipment starting up. The Eremite speaks.

	⁃	It is working. Start whenever you are ready.
A pause.
	⁃	OK?
	⁃	Yes.
Discovering Leprosy starts with a clearing of the throat in a gorgeous baritone and gets louder as the song progresses. 

- 

My cloak is on the ground
It is the skin from which I drink
For I trust no stream I come upon
My sword my tongue and larynx

Farewell, farewell, farewell
The game begins in earnest 
Farewell, farewell farewell
My secrets are my own.

Oh gods die
Fade into the woodland
Oh gods die
My people are too strong

Oh team have strength
Have strength without my aid
Oh team have strength
My path I walk alone

I will not leave the path
Or tell the truth to strangers 
The blood will show me where to go
The maze, the roost, the dangers

Farewell, farewell, farewell
The game begins in earnest 
Farewell, farewell farewell
My secrets are my own.


The song is cut short by a rousing and shouting by Kicking Sods Into Sea, and you hear the Eremite apologising frantically before the track cuts off. 

4 – Instrumental From The Town's Band with interior talk about the Kiss

An Untitled Song By The Town Band, March 21st.

A straight instrumental – no lead in. A song about the town. Half-way through the music cuts short with a crack and hiss, and the Eremite begins panicking and talking about the Kiss, with numbers and figures relating to the equation from earlier. The song then fades back in for the close.Song is about anthropology. 

All instruments – no capo apart from ukulele capo 2

Ukulele, Banjo, Guitar, Mandolin, Drums and various pieces from Korg

C Am F C G C G C G C G x2

Just Mandolin In The Verses, and Voice

Verse 1

Ooooooooooooooh mountain goat
Low down your trumpet of stone

Ooooooooooh scatterbird
Split apart in flight


Chorus 1 Am C Am F
Oh,Mountain do your thing
I won't intervene

I am like the wind
I age without touching

We hear a crackle and a fizz and the music fades, and the chanting voice of the Eremite is heard, without his mask, terrified.

	⁃	Reminder: Breathing in, breathing out. I did not breathe out. 5 litres per lung, twelve thousand particles per litre, 120000 particles in each breath. Held breath in. She made me hold breath in. 5 times 12000 times two. Breathing in, breathing out. I did not breathe out. I didn't breathe out, for fuck's sake. It's a coincidence. It's a coincidence. It's a coincidence. Come on. I did not breathe out. I didn't breathe out. Reminder Reminder Reminder. Erm... Success rate 2% - 2400 still operating. Healthy. Healthy healthy healthy. No symptoms. Mask on. No infection. No infection, mask on. Reminder reminder reminder. 

He begins whimpering slightly, and the crackle happens again and the music fades in for the final verse. 

3 ½ bars instrumental and then final verse. 

Closing Verse

Oooooooh genius
Write your books on me
Oooooooh I cannot read
But I hear you've written the death of me. 

Oh,Mountain do your thing
I won't intervene

I am like the wind
I age without touching

Then Two Bars Of Original Instrumental and Close. 

5 – Witchdoctor speech about the disease. 

Conversation On Last Night Of Sanity, June 25th.

The disease has kicked in. The Eremite seeks refuge with the Witch Doctor. Mr. Lights has thrown him out of the flat, and he talks to her about the future. 

There is a distant rumble, the sound of trees and steady dripping. 

Okay, it's ready. You don't mind having this here? 

No. Just leave it there.

Where can I sit? 

Anywhere. 

There aren't any chairs.

You better sit on the floor, then. 

A shuffling, and a sigh. 

A mess. 

Yes. 

It's nice to be away from the burning, really. 

Is it? 

A pause. 

Do you like my wand?

Let me see. 

A pause. 
Wow. That's quite a major piece. Iron, is it? 

I think. 

Why do you need the knife with it? 

I don't.

Was it a present?

Yes. 

A pause. 

You can have it when I die. 
 Excuse me? 

You can have the wand when I die. No one else will want it. Or have it. 

Oh... thank you. 

You are welcome. 

Why do they hate you?

Who?

The people who live here. 

I imagine because of what I am. 

A woman?

The woman.

What do you mean? 

I'm all of those Men who cut off their little, generators or whatever you want to call them in polite company. It's easier to hate someone else than yourself. 

You're like a totem?

Is that what other people you've met call it? 

Yes. 

Being hated? 

Yes.

Then I am a totem. Can you take your mask off?
I'm afraid not.

Whatever you are protecting yourself from? 

I am... ugly. 

Really? Your physique says otherwise. 

My mother forced herself upon my father. 

I see. 

I've never actually said that to anyone. I've just realised that I have never said that to anyone.  She was not an... attractive woman. 

Did you inherit her... attributes? 

Yes.

A pause. 

I imagine you are starting to regret coming here.

Things have taken a turn for the worse, haven't they?. 

I would like you to say my name.

Your name? 

I just don't think you can. Tea? 

Yes please. 

Go on. While I'm making it, just say my name. 

Alright...

The line becomes static and the voices fade for around 15 seconds. They start to come back in again mid-sentence.

...believe me?

I do.

I'm glad you do.... How do you know? 

You can see these things. I'm also a doctor.

The doctor?

The only doctor. I see these things.

Do you....

Two seconds of static.

No. I don't.

Good. 

And what about your girl? 

Friend? She's fine. 

What will you tell her? 

Anything she wants to hear. 

And when will you....

(static)

August... particles....

(static)


6 – Note from Love For All Gods

Leftovers, April.

Left on his device – you hear her trying to work it, and then leaving him a message of ambiguous love and slight illness

A crackle and a fizz and we hear the voice of Death of a Friend in media res. 

	⁃	it hear me? Can it see me? Does it work with crystals? What's that little light? Oh! I think it sees me. Right, just put this down here... over... right, rightey rightey right. Hello. I think you might be angry when you find this; I know you don't like me touching your things. But look at what I've got for you! (A rustle). It's the last one of the year, the meats still fresh, and as long as you're in tonight it still will be. If it smells of apricots just throw it out, but I thought it would be a nice gesture. You could make a stew. You can get coats out of them too, but it might be a little small on you. (Giggle). Only the ladies are poisonous, but this one's, well it's a big one, a big boy! So this is for you. 
	⁃	You're out again. Out talking and taking pictures, or walking with the Mayor. Wait, no, father's with the Mayor, so I sincerely hope you aren't with them. That would be horrible. 
	⁃	I've straightened your things, and hung up the picture I sent you. Father was sorry, you know, he really was. But, I hope you checked inside the frame. You aren't the only one who can hide things! But I promise I haven't checked inside your suitcase. My family can keep promises. 
	⁃	I saw the little girl from upstairs today. She looked terrible, her father as well, like they hadn't slept in weeks, and she was so dirty! There was all this ash or soot all over her head, and I thought to say something, but he looked so awful I didn't want to make a peep. 
	⁃	Erm, I've made a list of things I would like to do. I'm going to read them out. Oh... oh the light just went out. Hello? Hello! Oh, no, wait, there it is. I really hope this thing is listening to all this rubbish. 
	⁃	So, I would like to go to the Dexter's but not Sinister's, which is not allowed, you know, you have to go in both but we could buy something and just run. I would also like to... kiss on the bridge, the one that looks a bit like a man lying down, upriver. We'd be quite close to Father but that would be OK. I would also like to read with you. I know you've got all those books, and I would like to lie in bed with bacon in the pan and the window shut and just... read for a bit. I want to show you the mushroom caves, as well. That's a good one, they're shut in spring but if we go down on the first of June we'll be the first ones in. Right at the back there's one the size of a house which has been there for ages, and we can look at that. Maybe you can write about it. 
	⁃	Are you writing about me? I'm just curious. Not that I would ever look, but I just want to know if you are. I like the idea of you writing about me. It makes me feel a bit more... worth. If someone takes the bother of writing something about you, you must matter. Otherwise they wouldn't bother. 
	⁃	I don't know if you check this at all, or if you just get rid of things without checking, or you'll hear this when you leave and you're hundreds of miles away and forgetting about me. I don't want to believe her, but Trousers Whipping In Wind told me that you have been up to all sorts, with the theatre staff, and the women in the butchers'. I don't think that's you. I don't believe her, she knows it will upset me. And I'm not going to ask you about it. That would be far more grown-up of me. 
	⁃	There's a lot of you I don't know about and that's okay. I don't really know much about anything. You kind of teach me as well as love me. Erm, I mean... what... oh, err... Well, no, come on, I do love you. And I think you love me. And we're a bit different, aren't we? Everyone in this town is the same. 
	⁃	So yes. I love you. I love you. I love you. It kind of sounds like a sneeze when you say it fast. I love you. Iloveyou! (Laughs). Well, I'm going to bed. Enjoy your dinner when you get home, rub some paprika in it is the best thing to do, really. I'll see you tomorrow. Remember, bring boots and those overalls I gave you. The shore's slippy.
	⁃	
	⁃	Goodnight. I hope you're walking around out there writing about me. Not this boring place.  Write about me! Write about me! Remember me! (Laughs). Goodnight. (A few seconds pass.) Goodnight! I haven't gone. But I am going now. (a few seconds pause) GOODNIGHT! (laughing and swearing as she tries to turn the machine off).
