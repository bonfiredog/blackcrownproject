            <Text>Unsavoury Methods (To Avoid)

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A/B_testing

I do not wish to engage in this; regional or demographic tweaking is not a tool of literature. The idea here is not profitability; this form of marketing shows an inherent lack of trust in the material, and has never been employed before. It is an unsavoury part of digital marketing and not something that digital narratives should adopt. The same is true of DRM and restrictive measures. I seek:

OPENNESS
COMPATIBILITY
EASE
TRUST
ETHICS 
TRANSPARENCY

There should be more channels of communication than just a web form.

Facebook, Twitter, and other social networks

I am not entirely against adding these, but what do they really bring to the experience? Is it necessary or desirable to have these features? I don’t see them adding anything to the text, and in fact in some cases they will detract from the experience in jarring ways. There are more analog ways to use them to spread word of mouth, but I have no desire for people to tweet their progress, or engage with their friends in an intrusive way. A Facebook page, Twitter discussion; these are fine ways of using these sites as tools, third-party to the narrative, and not impinging on them. Does integration really lead to wider popularity? I am not so sure. And if it does, I am not sure it will with this piece. This is not “audience-friendly”. It may be “difficult”, but this is not an admonition. Digital narratives can succeed where videogames have failed; they need not be afraid of their own shadow.  I am glad that Failbetter wish Twitter and Facebook to be used for themselves.

Tutorials

I do not plan to include tutorials or hand-holding; if this is needed, I am not performing my job properly. People reading this work are assumed to have a basic web literacy; we debase the whole thing by trying to make it “accessible” to people who do not have the slightest interest in learning. Progression is natural, intuitive, and in many directions. 

Treating readers in a certain way
Do not make readers feel stupid. They are vital, and should not be cheated. They should wish to delve into the subjects raised, and find the necessary detail elsewhere. When interacting with them, such interaction should not serve the self, but the story and their intelligence. I am not sure if I am the Eremite, or his successor, or just a researcher in the Institute myself, and should play that role. Everyone gains narrative as currency, as much or as little as they want or are willing to collect, and there is always another floor for them to reach, to become a ceiling. Narrative supports a database of interest. There are more layers between myself and the reader, but the objective should be to maintain a vital link, and make it feel more immediate, for all of the distance. It is also still a question whether players should be led for narrative effect, and whether this is any different from writing that deliberately provokes a biased way of thinking. I disagree with Jonathan Blow who says that this is unworthy. All art provokes emotion, and all artificial art has a message or purpose behind it. I do not want to take their details - in fact, I have a specific storied reason not to care about their lives. I do not want to tell them how they should feel about the work. Never create the cracks for the 

Rewards for cash

Content is its own reward. DO NOT DO THIS. There will be no digital carrot, no need to skip the actual playing of the game. Why do people want this? There should be no waiting tactics. 

No endgame

There should be an end. The experience should not be prolonged. This undermines the message and the pacing. 

Achievements and levelling

The story is the level, and how you change are not affected by numbers. 

Pricing

This is tricky, and something that needs to be discussed at length and which I need to be involved in. Highly slashing prices, or introducing monthly fees, I believe are ways that devalue and trivialise the experience. I think, aside from testing, there should be a payment for access, in which is included “ownable” items; a transcript of the experience, extra content, music. DRM also is not needed as the music is tied to experience; no-one will substitute for the entire experience, which is convoluted and not an easily “ownable” environment. You cannot steal an environment.  I’m also not sure about tiers of pricing; does this say that for more money you can understand it “more”? Extra content for more money, sure, but for unlocking content? I think that there should be a flat fee. It is still a question whether sales and low prices actually do devalue experiences, but it is a valid one. And where can value be added if it is necessary? I should look for ways to give people rewards without people paying for them. 

DRM

DRM clearly does not work. It may keep people out for a little while, but you fight a losing battle that damages legitimate customers. This has been shown time and time again, and books, and digital works, are just entering this field. Would it not be wonderful if we could actually learn from these mistakes in other mediums and bypass them, saving lots of money and surprising everybody? It should not be a novelty for a company to trust its customers, but it is.  

Failbetter’s Methods

On the whole, I am a fan of Failbetter’s approach. Fallen London is fun, literate and different. I’m not a big fan of the &quot;Echo This&quot; options everywhere, and feel that there should be an automatic journalling of what happens, in an attractive format, to streamline the UI. The menus aren't nested well, or spell-checked. Despite all the “ethical” treatment, there is still manipulation. Convenience always wins, so how far should the clasping of the hand go? Part of the issue is that it is still, after all, grinding. But the story is read maybe once, and then a second time, and this repetition does have its place. I need to find the middle way, or the fairest way. There is a push towards monetization in Failbetter’s methods, and I am starting to understand the reason for this. Freemium works because people do not bounce off a paywall - an honest policy is what is needed, not a complete dismissal of the freemium model. Most people pay for fate to grind, and so the freemium model does need to be tweaked, as the grind is not something we want to emulate.

Not describing what they do - therefore how 
do we make it exciting?

What do we replace the grind with? 

(archivist option leads to outside forum 
access)

THis system is hard to write for, as it encourages grind. 

Is this just a different style, however?

Do we want things hidden on their own? Do we need the access codes to point
out where they might be useful. 

The repeatable tasks should be a smaller part, an optional grind 

Rewards for being the first one to do things, or in the top portion. 

Incompetent bad as it continually punishes (and makes more likely) failure
Should it have a fringe benefit instead, or chances to completely reverse 
fortune?

Memes are more like a disease than anything else; they spread, and only change if they have to. Or do they? Would we say that there is a lot of invention here? 

Do we use the meme model to explain the spread of civilisation and new ideas through this incredibly tiny town. 

It is ludicrous, really; nothing this small could exist and support itself. But, for the Eremite, it stubbornly refuses to not exist. 

The dating works strangely, and must be decoded. Is there a year zero? Does he use glyphs?

            <Title>3D Models Introduction</Title>
            <Text>3D MODELS Unified Features HIGH DETAIL The quality of these should not be understated - they need to be objects of obsession for readers, especially readers who miss tactility and texture in their artistic lives lived online. They need to have geometry, and fluid operation, high pixels, refraction and reflection. TEXTURE This is separate from detail, and refers to the high density of these objects - they need to feel and look real, to them. MANIPULABILITY Each object will be different, but they all have a degree of manipulability; they can be turned, rotated, altered in some way. Some may be puzzles of manipulability, like a Rubix cube or rhythm game, whilst, for others, the manipulability is there only to highlight their physicality. You can even combine items, and relate them to the Office content very closely. ACCESS CODES Many of these objects provide Access Codes - triggers which either offer a bonus to new players of the game (and directing them to sign up) or changing the state of something within an existing player’s profile. These can be limited to a certain number of players, or used an infinite number of times as a recruitment tool. PUZZLES As mentioned above, these puzzles can be text-based, logic-based, manipulable, coded, hyperlinked, or many other forms. The unifying factor is that all pieces have layers of depth to uncover.</Text>

Storylet Ideas

Olive, Cedar, Palm, Cyprus 

Wireless Inoculation

- Piercing the skin is primitive. The Institute wishes to explore another avenue for inoculation. 
- This quest really asks what inoculation, on a biological and spiritual level, truly is, and what the Institute hopes to achieve by it. 

Polo’s Slave

- Marco Polo left a slave from the Tartars in his will - he is linked to the Institute, and becomes the focus of one of the quests.

The Archetypal Story

- A player is presented with three archetypal stories, and must decide which one is right.
- In other storylets, and the Miasma, a tune is played lightly in certain places. 
- If the player goes to the Tarot Harp, they can play the tune, and the names of the strings used (and the order that they are used in) will tell them which story is correct.

Musical Notation

- A piece of music is hidden within other Miasma Content, as well as the Office Content, in musical instrumentation; players who gather all the parts must post a video of the piece being played to win something, and unlock a new revelation for all players. 

Insurance

- If you survive your time at the Institute, you are paid - how can this be built into a storylet?

The Mouth Riddle

- Use the mouth riddle, where the number of teeth in the mouth relate to a cypher. The mention in the book of looking at teeth is a shortcut to anthropology. Something in the book is there as well, part of the puzzle that relates. The book is mentioned explicitly.

“Fevered Nights” 

- This is a quality that is related to a quest.

The Physicality Of Responsibility

- How does always being physically ill effect their interactions? This is a question that can feed into several quests, involving love, sex, pain and disease in intensely human situations. 

White Man’s Burden

- This guilt sits at the centre of the Institute. Perhaps they only employ white people, and this cultural concentration is causing problems of inbreeding and decay.

Keep It All Clean

 - The OCD of someone who works in a “clean” room.

Sam

 - Add Sam as a character. On his website, does it say that he has disappeared, for a short time?

The Giant Gas Mask

- A gas mask for the entire country.

Move To Another Department

 - This is only temporary (perhaps at the end of the story arc), but would allow a player to move to a new department, in return for treachery, information, or perhaps personal sacrifice.

The Old Book

- Use a phrase from an old book that is very rare in a puzzle, so that players need to find it themselves.  

Text Entry

- Must enter a passcode for this storylet.

Usernames

- Everyone’s username becomes a scrambled (or unscrambled) part of the narrative - email to: and from:

The Kuru

The Kuru are mentioned as part of a storylet. 

The Keyboard

- An alternate keyboard where physical buttons pressed relate to other letters being pressed. This is part of a code that should be

            <Title>Interface</Title>
            <Text>INTERFACE Features Many Logins Options are important with logins; people do not necessarily want to create another account, and another password, with every service they join. Therefore, though people can create a Black Crown account, they may also use an existing Storynexus account, a Google account, a Facebook or Twitter account. Whichever service they login with will automatically be used as their preferred method of contact. They can connect others if they wish, but must make a conscious effort to do so. This gives choice whilst limiting notification fatigue. Notifications Features such as that of ‘Living Stories’ require notification. However, in a world where everything has a notification bell or chirrup, we must differentiate ourselves, by being both memorable and non-intrusive. In-character email messages are a start, but finding some way to not just remind the players but draw them in crucial. Hyperlinking And Interconnectivity The Institute (or at least the login) is hyperlinked from the Miasma, but, in the reverse, there is a much richer web of links out from specific questlines to pieces of the Miasma, that utilise both the Miasma pieces themselves and the puzzles that are integrated into them to advance quests within the Institute; this has the additional benefit of allowing them to find those pieces of the Miasma that they may have missed. The ability to access other parts of the experience from your current location is one of the abilities that the medium has over any other. Linked essays, Wikipedia entries, websites and places of learning will also allow players to actually research their way through the game. Nex The project will be linked to Storynexus, at least by ecosystem if not aesthetically. It will not use the orange bar, or be attached to any other storyworlds under the Storynexus umbrella. It will, however, use Nex, the currency of the Storynexus project. This is to allow very easy cross-compatibility by existing Storynexus users. I do wonder how this will affect the casual users, or non-gamers who are not used to virtual currency; they may prefer a paid-for app, or a subscription model. These can be investigated after launch, but at the start we wish to keep the experience free-to-play and very simple. I think that we will need to layout how Nex works for users who do wish to experiment. Virtual currency is a difficult thing to balance and seem fair (think of Microsoft Points) but done well they can work, I hope. Files Cards do work in the Storynexus universe, but for Black Crown I think that files fit the aesthetic better, whilst functioning in almost the same way. They are compartmentalised experiences that have a random element, and this means that they can work on many different levels. We may complicate it with an inbox/outbox system, or something related to diseases (each disease rewarded should arrive via a vector in a file). Actions Actions are an important concept, and should not be discarded in this game. They could be represented by a bitten-down pen, a petri dish, the lines of the Widsith’s logo (which should be present on every screen already), a syringe, a declining graph, or another metaphor. The declining actions reinforce the central theme of decay, and topping up one’s actions could be compared (in-game) to revitalising oneself for the task ahead. Qualities Qualities function in much the same way that they do in Fallen London - they represent markers of progress or setback, and may be in any conceivable form. This is a pleasing inversion of game theory, a very broad category, and useful for keeping track of a player’s progress. However, I think the problem that remains with them is their representation in the flow of the game. One recieves a quality every time a branch in a storylet is resolved, and there are so many to keep track of it is hard to do so. Apart from important characters, items and ongoing stories, perhaps it would be best to move qualities to a profile tab, or larger area, where they can be perused at a later date. The sidebar would be a little more streamlined in such a case. Diseases These are a key feature, separate from the inventory or qualities. They are displayed prominently in the sidebar for every character, perhaps in a sort of modular fashion.They increase abilities, unlock areas, and are general markers of progress and boasting. However, they are unique in that they make you more physically decrepit and disgusting, causing you a wild variety of effects. They are best to be thought of as “Featured Qualities”. The question now arises, however, as to whether we need qualities such as Stealth, Violence or any of those at all, or rather just simplify it into the diseases as the main qualities. Diseases should also interact with each other in a variety of different ways. . Factions There are many different departments and factions within the Insitute, and all of them vie for resources and power in what is essentially a flat structure. The players, when they sign-up, join the highest faction, but find it under threat from within and without. They interact with other factions, though they do not join them, and their relationships to those factions are controlled by the story. Inventory Fallen London is a city of traders, where each player is a (usually) free agent gathering resources for their own plans. Black Crown, instead, takes place within a work environment, where the need for specialist tools are already catered for. The inventory, and opportunities to fill it, become a sort of stationery black market, for gathering items that would suit their side missions and plans. And, of course, the currency of the Institute is the pen. Players and employees, in the culture of the Institute, are hoarders because of the imminent change that is coming, the ascendancy. Not everyone is sure what it means, and whether it is a good thing, and their awareness of the transience of life as diseased things leads them to hoard, to bear witness to what will be lost to them soon. Miasma Collection Players of the game need a way to collate Miasma that they have found. This is a key advantage over not signing up at all, and is necessary to process the information contained within them, to make connections and draw conclusions. There needs to be a space where if a player visits a piece of Miasma while logged in, the API registers it and adds it to their “collection” in the Institute, where they can move pieces around, visit them directly, and make notes directly on the collection.</Text>

            <Title>Proposed Features</Title>
            <Text>3D InvPlanningentory Of Objects - This can include minor objects, of no importance to the plot (or seemingly no importance). - Perhaps a digital representation of the gas mask, with audio running if left for hours, or “equipped”. - They exist within a frame of reference, as museum objects. - They are 3D-modelled, and can be opened, toyed with, taken apart, and manipulated at will. Writing still remains at the heart of this, and they are not part of the inventory, but rather parts of the text. - These are not easily integrated into Jonathan, but perhaps can be created with another company (who created the David Eagleman app) and integrated somehow. Elements should also be considered. - They can be manipulated and opened, not just rotated. If they are hosted on a separate site, this may be useful, fiction-wise. - A potential problem may be bugs in different browsers. Audio Recordings - These can be from people in the town, the Eremite, the other employees of the Widsith, or many other sources, which can perhaps be downloaded to the desktop. Piracy is not really an issue here, as they do not mean much outside the game world. - This will include original music, that may be performed live by the Loss Town Band, and also available separately. - They can be collated, compared, and also manipulated - some tracks may have secret parts, or reveal something. We should not underestimate the persistence of some users. Musical Notation - Musical Notation, when played along to, can reveal other pieces of music, or be downloaded for covers which may unlock something within the game world. Video Recordings - These will be less frequent, but may be used by the Widsith Institute to communicate with their staff or for staff members to record messages to each other. This may include use of Skype, or something similar. Illustration - I like a variety of different styles, and while the main use will be with the Eremite (I was thinking something along the lines of Chris Riddell) this also encompasses maps, woodcuts, paintings, illuminations, sketches, and many others, in many differing styles. These are embedded into the text. - Paul believes that we move away from illustration into the “found object” style. I do agree that we should move away from cartoons, but sketching is still important. Animation - This is not something about which I have a huge opinion, but it may be something to think about and use ourselves. I can’t see an immediate application for it, however. Photography - Most of it is vintage photography, taken by the Eremite, and becomes the sole visual evidence of the town. Much of this is edited and censored, and his role as photographer is discussed at length. Interconnected Sites And Links - A sense of isolation on the web seems contrary to this project, but must be achieved. - The site contains most of the narrative, but for some parts it would be good to set up basic, linkable pages and other places of learning, perhaps to an internal wiki, written by staff members, that collates findings. - If a piece of text is referred to later, it can be brought up immediately for perusal. Hidden Function - This is a more mechanical function, utilising affordances of web technology to hide functions and content for the more determined reader. Codes, glitches, and secret digital “areas” can all be shared by a superstitious underclass. Public-Domain Footage And Audio - This is subject to copyright, but could be used to illustrate a wider remit of the Institute and create a sense of history. Glossary, Appendices, Bibliography, Marginalia, Comments And Footnotes - These all come under a similar headline. A medieval scatter-brain approach is used here, with drawings, and writings, spread apart. I must be careful to not, House Of Leaves-style, break the flow of the work too much. However, House Of Leaves may have worked better with this modular approach! These can be notes from the Eremite, from other users, from the Institute, from townspeople, sketches, lists, equations, asides, bibliography (with fake and real books), glossary of terms, dictionary, and many others, to bring in this idea of “an accumulation of ideas over time, with refinement” of the Great Scrapbook tradition. Source Collection - A meta-database of my influences and recommendations, separate from the work, but accessible from many points within it. Maps - Maps need not be finished. They can overlap and contradict, be drawn by amateurs as well as professionals. They create a cone of time, pulling in other parts of the text, and codifying it. - Maps come from official and unofficial sources, and link to the rest of the text. Writing - Infection charts and scales. - There are, of course, almost limitless numbers of verbal artefacts that can be used; poetry, prose, diary entries, receipts, holy texts, lists, registers, notes, reviews, programmes, transcripts, lyrics, and many others. All should be used, but only if it makes sense. Online Communities - A forum may take on the name of the village, and other villages, laid to waste by disaster, disease and war. This is to honour them, to write about them and invent with kindness. We may initiate this process, but have no hand in it. The Widsith Institute will be the only connecting factor. - Along with the “internal wiki” (a forum for users) we should encourage, but not directly influence, the spread of other forums. Digital Musical Instruments - Replications of musical instruments from Loss and the Eremite, that can be played to unlock new content, or merely for fun. Note-Taking And Analysis - A tentative proposal to include in-game analysis that can be viewed by others. I think this may be best confined to external forums, but this idea of research is important to the experience. Organic, Shifting Nature - The piece is never still, whether through manual intervention or programmed variation. Replacement, deletion; all of these pieces work together. But they are not time-dependent, or global; they depend on the player’s progress, not their input. - The question of why the Institute, or the work itself, is changing elements can create a “versioned frenzy”, where previous versions of texts can be recorded and analyzed. Each change is important, though not obvious. Diary/Journal Function - One’s progress could be recorded automatically for a separately-viewable, perhaps purchaseable “book” that shows a unique journey through the text, with the text (and art) included. This could be generated automatically, logged to a profile, and purchased at the end of the experience. Loss Town Band - A real band, with musicians acting the parts of the town orchestra, ostensibly saved from the town and made to tour by an unscrupulous manager. Their music would be included in the app, and certain cross-overs would be made between them. Physical Editions - I have talked about this briefly above, but the possibility arises for physical editions of the scrapbook, art books, music books, and other physical editions of the piece.</Text>

            <Title>Questions</Title>
            <Text>K!K!K! - What do the K!K!K! Players wear to protect from the narrative? And how can one answer this question without the inherent triteness? They are writing their own history, and lying about it. - What does this name mean, and how does it relate to the game at large? WEED OUT THE WEAKNESSES. Townspeople - How can the reaction of the townsfolk vary? They cannot ALL be hostile - there needs to be chinks of revelation. - What do they do in between his recordings? Can the narrator be subverted, and the audience allowed to trick him, to slip past his vigilance? - What happened to Gagging’s family? - Does the town crier have a connection to the outside world?  - Is the Mayor from outside. - What do they wear? - Why do they hate the sea? - Are they scared of all water? - What do they do at the birth of a child? - What are the motives of the chroniclers of Loss? - How do they feel about fluids in their bodies? - What kind of hats do they wear? - What are the “stock poses that people adopt, and what are the unusual ones? - What about the people who all look the same? - Who is sleeping together? - What is underneath their clothes, or what do they think is under there? - Can we make masks? - How do they react? Mythology - How does the “great Man” differ from ordinary man? - What would the first words be? A sneeze, “where is your face”, “who’s there”? Statement or question? - How does Loss fit in with the world myth canon? - How do they handle ancestors? - What does happen after death? - Heidegger - how does one become a being in the first place? - What is being is a worthy question. - Decay and being are very closely linked. - A philosophy of decay. - World disclosure - the Eremite has little reference for these objects, and the situations they are used in are wrong. - It is almost as if the people of the town are playing as humans, just while he is there. - But they are not aliens - are they constructs?

            <Text>Actual Construction We have a hub with a general progression towards completion, as well as a built-in API for talking to other websites. Puzzles will be both complex and simple, challenging as well as courting player expectations whilst creating the uncanny, not frustration. I do not wish to incur content debt - make sure that things are planned out before you embark upon them, or at least that you have the time to embark upon them. The platform, low-tech and widely available, now, as Jordan Mechner says, makes sense in a way it has not for a long time. Game forms come back in a different skin, to address different issues. Here, adventure and inventory court the lack of adventure, the armchair tradition that the Institute “employees” fulfil. We will need to watch for feature creep, and keep a focus on a tight schedule. We cannot be too precious with features, and will need to work out the time and blocking inherent in planning and implementing features. HTML 5 and cross-compiling will make the web a platform all its own in the coming years. The Work Itself There will be an unlimited (theoretically) greater mythology, that is expansive but not spoiling. The order in which people progress matters little, though “strong” and “weak” paths will exist. There will be a series of templates into which I put content. The UI of the work will be a consistent, custom corporate one, a literal “frame” around which to view the work. These are pieces that have already happened, though the system changes them as we go. A player will unlock more as they progress, and will encounter no gimmicks; everything they find will serve the story. Story can be more important than gameplay, at points, and vice versa - the pendulum swings as you go. This is ergodic literature. Traversing the text is not trivial, and includes the rules for its own use that exist outside of ordinary literary contexts. However, I am not sure that there are ways to be “successful” or not in traversing the text, any more than there in any literature. Content and comprehension are the processes of success. Navigating the experience comes from intuition and learning. There needs to be a mix of the two, with perhaps surprises periodically. Counterintuitiveness does not have to be a punishment, as it can be in games; it can provide new ways of interaction. Naive users especially will find everything novel, but looking at who will view this work, other users must be accounted for as well, with separate personal histories of experience. One always experiences the interface before the work, and natural and unnatural mapping plays a definite role in shaping the experience. Affordances can play a large role, circumventing expectations. An object’s perceived affordances could be treated as actual, and experimentation can be rewarded. Rewards are not marked, but exist within an environment of possibility; you are not sure what you will recieve, but you will recieve something. Steering is important for players, but with subtlety, and with breadth for exploration - “ineffable exploration” that occurs in a book. Allowing to impress themselves upon the game world are important, as well. There is a way to present a story but allow you to be the director of certain types of experiences. The MUD is a certain comparison - a way to shut off personalities and inhabit others for a while. Socialiser, Achievers, Explorer, Killer, all are there to self-discover and fulfil roles. There is a sense of presence rather than just communication. The opaqueness of the world is what attracts the price - it is a lucky dip, where you take the statistics and mechanics on faith. You won’t be paying any more, and so you do not need to know what is coming. The mystery would be maddening if you were continually paying for a distant denouement. The work should never be afraid of its medium. Control is easy to keep with the player, but not with the web. A game is not a puzzle - puzzles are static, games change with the player’s actions. Opposition, roleplaying, resource, goals, management and diversity make a game. The toy does not make the game either - the player’s interaction with the toy is the most important thing. Interaction is not interesting, but meaningful decisions. Decisions relating to the game state at that moment and weighing it against resources and opposition. Goals are as good as victory conditions. Struggle and survival are the keys here. The management of resources creates meaning in their decisions beyond “black” and “white”. Decisions need to be brought up in every part, and, as has been said, made meaningful with variety. Resources are used via tokens, and both must be managed to be successful. Enough information to make a sensible decision, sometimes. Non-exclusive goals lead to diplomacy, but it should never rest. The unexpected and random is useful, if not over-used. Identification should be clear - what’s your position? What should you be worrying about? A balance between role-playing and power fantasy. Roleplaying CAN be conducted on one’s own. Calling it a performance implies that there is no inherent value of play in roleplaying, that is only for an audience’s benefit. This is wrong. Games should encourage socialisation. Narrative tension should build, and not anti-climax. However, repetition and grind has its place, economically and narratively. There should be a distinction between individual events and grind events. However, the more repetitive elements are more generic and more game-like; this does, however, remove a creation burden. A simple, valued progression, with failure mechanics that are not too harsh and differentiation in rewards, is where one will find balance. Stat raises should be smaller, 1-20 instead of 1-200. This makes each level-up more meaningful, and more desired. Levelled, scaleable content removes a sense of agency. Do not put vital information in blocks of text, because it will be missed! Unless, of course, one wants it to be missed. The engine, an the appetite of the audience, are also important. The ludic element is essential. We should refer to interactivity and experience rather than a “game” when talking to Random House - they are not in the business of creating games. Push-storytelling not just “push the button”. Audiences are the Anti-Smaug - resources grow to large amounts so that the particulars of a large hoard become meaningless. HIMBL- Hierarchical Immediately Meaningful Bling - structure, and layered qualities and trophies that increase and upgrade as you continue. Qualities have relationships between them, and the player should spend more than gold. Reward may be bad, and punishment may be good. However, how far to we want to numerate abstract qualities? Does this improve them. At what point do we have to say “let’s try and make the player feel a chunk of this, rather than giving them 10 feelings of hopelessness”. It is the designer’s fault if players just grind the less interesting content! The game is looking to be 2 months long, with skill progressions from 1-25, as compacting works better. A pacing wheel (see below) is in place at every other skill level. A higher-level option is usually easier. Progress qualities lead to ways to buy storylets, and transient awards such as currency. Skills increase as a result. Skills do not have to increase at the same point all the time. Guarantee that they always have something to look at. Unlocks are important, and structure progressions. The main portion of the Miasma content, however, should be discovered, not unlocked, and clicked to share with friends. Qualities should be treated with parsimony. Departmental flavour leads to a storybeat followed by a token. A 500 word limit has been imposed on storylets. Monetisation occurs only on the corporate side. TYPES OF MECHANIC APPROACH: In general, a storylet generate qualities, which in turn lead to more storylets. Highway The simplest, a standard progression from A to B to C. However, new content is not visible to most people in this model if they are at different points, and there is little reason to return to content if you are further ahead. This is simplistic, and unrewarding is any sense other than a narrative one. Carousel One completes a certain number of A objectives, to open up B, a wider vista, which in terms leads to C. A way to level content with more choice and agency, with a more elegant “unpacking” mechanic than the Highway approach. It values qualities far more highly, and offers a choice to progress, or whether to remain at the current level. Pacing Wheel Initial costs and variations in the start of a progression leads to a standardised “middle” section, followed by a number of outcomes. Grandfather Clock A objectives have a certain value, one of the “minute hand”. B objectives have an “hour hand” quality. Chaining and combining them to produce new “times” adds a degree of hierarchy and choice, while keeping the less valuable As relevant, and promoting replay. The final objective, C, is more important and only played once. Midnight Staircase This is much like a cross between the Highway, and the Grandfather Clock. An increasing scale of resource qualities provides tempting spending opportunities along the way, and costs increase the further one goes. At the top is the best spending opportunity, but the staircase assumes that players will spend and reclimb the staircase several times before reaching the top. Access Codes These allow alternate ways into a text, with intriguing ways to guide players to certain parts of content and to tell their friends. A puzzle inserted here provides even greater intrigue. These are often used in ARGs, though it is not clear when you have solved a problem. Part of this problem is that it is not a well-bounded experience. We have decided, I think, that real-world gigs is the boundary of this experience.</Text>

            <Text>Disease A positive particle requires a negative substrate. CO2 has a removable bond between the carbon and one oxygen. THE DISEASE HAS TO BE A PARTICULATE OR A GAS. Viruses Bacteria Fungi Protozoa Multi-cellular parasites Prions No symptoms for a while. Bad food, objects, inhalations, vector objects Health allows them to travel. “You have overwhelmed me with all your waves” “You have taken from me my closest friends, and made me repulsive to them” You have taken from me friend and neigbour - darkness is my closest friend. Job - test by god - an Eremite? Explosive diarrhoea is to find new hosts. Combatting The Disease Mop suits - at different levels of protection. Filled with: charcoal, sponges. Ornamentation: a starfish design. Much like a plague doctor. Alternate design - a hood with two hoses hanging to the floor. Sponges at the end? A calcified mess The Eremite wonders from which holes his body will exude the disease. The Gas Mask A gas mask that extends down the throat. An acid-soaked bag Rapid development. Charcoal - a common component, oxidised wood, a high surface area - can be burnt to restore it. Coconuts, chestnuts, horse-chestnuts, peach stones - collected from the people in the town. Tailored resin - toxin bonding to it. Breathe out when putting it on. Challenge Agents - Camphor, banana flavourant. Stacks of Banana Angel Delight A drinking straw The filter itself must be protected. Rubber degrades. Filter soaks up chemcials which becomes harmful. Where are the filters? What do the inhibit? Absorption - the illness filters out of the CO2. If the glass shatters, the wearer is blinded. Usually a military device - what is its providence? What is in the filter? Historical Plagues Plague Of Justinian Influenza Smallpox Spanish Flu Pestmeester - plague doctor in Dutch. Usually poor doctors - public servants They do not touch, and wear wax overcoats. Much like he cannot touch. How the nature of touch changes an epidemic. Recorders rather than helpers. They took the pulse and took off clothes with a stick. Fined for this - negotiations of payment. Protected by: Amber Storax Myrrh Cloves Laudanum Camphor Rose Petals Nostradamus, Giovanni De Ventura, Niall O Glacain, Paracelsus - all plague doctors. But no need to drive it home - give it to the players to find for themselves. Became a commedia dell’arte character. Long quarantine, live in isolation. Yersinia Pestis China was the source of the plague of Justinian, the emperor who caught the disease but survived - was he the first Eremite?It stopped the Romans. He taxed living neighbours for their dead compatriots. Saxons did not talk about the plague. 25 million people died. The next epidemic was the Black Death. Medicinal Cannibalism Apoplexy “The King’s Drops” - human skull in alcohol Usnea - moss over the skull Spanish Flu Influenza afflicting healthy young people, not the old and infirm. Spread to the Arctic 50-130 millon victims Over a quarter of the world’s population was infected. Cytokine Storm - made the immune system over-react in healthier, more robust immune systems. Media blackouts to affect morale. War increased transmission Andrew Price-Smith - changed the war. Modern transportation systems. No-one knows where it originated. Case-Fatality Ratio Tafari Makonnen (Haile Selaissie) contracted the disease but survived. Nosebleeds, stomach, intestines Edema/Dropsy: The severely ill travelled, because of the war, back home, HOW IS A COMMUNITY AFFECTED? Leave orders outside Steam shovel and buried without coffins Western Samoa - 90% were infected. Marajo - island in Amazon Delta, only place not affected. Becomes less lethal with time, to increase the number of living hosts. “Forgotten Pandemic” The war deflected the deaths, limited media coverage, rapid disappearance, an “extension of the war’s tragedies Exclusively a disease of human beings. Disease was seen as god incarnate, or at least God’s will. By accepting disease (the gods) they return to their true form - but they do not want to. They have been decaying, into mongoloids - but is this the fever-dream of the Eremite? Look more at the witchdoctor, in all of this. Loss fails to spread the disease - it does not travel. Work on the symptoms - what do the gods want? Gods bring disease but are not usually disease itself. Nosoi, Pestis, Lues, Morbus, Tabes, Macies Buffy Coat - white blood cells but an item? Humorism Phlegm, yellow bile, black bile, blood. Cambium - humor. Change is caused by vapors absorbed. The Institute tries to incorporate every medical theory into their work. Juice, sap, flavour. Dyscrasia - sounds like disgrace. Humors imbalanced Eucrasia - balanced humors Usually the miasmata came from locales, not people. He is a mobile miasma. Paan - gambir paste - stop the miasma. Nebula in Latin. Suspicions About The Hidden Realities Of The Air Effuvia Poisonous breath of swamp creatures. Insect waste - dead air. Edwin Chadwick - “All Smell Is Disease” John Snow - anti-Miasma William Farr - pro-Miasma Farr admitted after Snow’s death that the theory was wrong based on statistics. Zymote - zymotic disease - fermenting disease Rotting vegetation spreads the disease. Cold air spread disease. Antoine Bechamp - immortal germs make up humans, not cells. Bacteria grew from here. All of this ties into the gods quite nicely. Can take centuries to identify a new pathogen. - sometimes no animal models - Existing theories - Some harmless organisms look like diseases. Such a messy process of trial and error. Draw a phylogenetic tree? They are transferring what amounts to a meme - a bad way of doing something. He is transmitting culture to them. Memes = remembrance Horizontal transmission Imitation is a clear pattern here. The spread of his ideas and actions. Like scared pigeons around a room. Between parents and children - what is the relationship like, there? Proselytism “Great pox” - syphilis 26th October 1977 - last case of naturally occurring smallpox Alastrim Rinderpest - the name of another fidget? One related to cows? Sheets of blisters Turbid, opalescent tissue debris Vaccine comes from vacca - cow Material from a cowpox lesion to vaccinate. Vaccinia virus - where did it come from? Wireless disease inoculation - piercing the skin is so primitive. “Nothing should cut us” Clades - a group of organisms derived from a common ancestor. Divergence dates Comes from a rodent virus An evolution of this disease Not the worst, or the most virulent, but what differentiates it? More about his illnesses, his biological tics and features, his coughs and spews Sopona, Sitala Mata - deities of smallpox The Book Of Smallpox and Measles Henry Bedson - head of disease resaerch at the university of Birmingham, committed suicide after Janet Parker, a medical photographer, contracted the disease and died. Smallpox scabs tucked in an envelope in a book. So many great people hid the scars Lincoln was quarantined with smallpox shortly after the Gettysburg address. A broom moves the disease along Stalin had scars - used photo-retouching to cover it up. The colour red can treat smallpox - draw the blood up to meet its fellows. Not sure about this. Erythema - redness of the skin Secret history - Procopius Everyone was made ugly by illness - how did this change things?</Text>

            <Title>Religion</Title>
            <Text>The Teenage Moon - venerated, the vessel, the Elysium, and hated by the young. How does it compare to other civilisations. Why Sigurd? The comfort of Nordics - they look like their gods. Other races do not. All religions are products of chance and stupidity. Sympathetic magic - emulating, fetishising, a childish simulacrum Sympathetic magic is at work in the Institute. “Poppet” instead of puppet. Their version of English comes without cultural inspirations - what is the cut-off point? Consecrating or re-enacting. Trance states, dark caves, paintings. Participation Mystique - no concept of the individual in the deep past. More of the role of the Mayor as a dying king. Mortification Jokes and popular beliefs. Artifact, describable or transmissible entity (oral), culture, behaviour (rituals) Folklore it is not, as it is the DOMINANT BELIEF STRUCTURE - no diversion from this. The folklore comes from the young, or the old? The young are staid, the old want something better? Urban legends, gossip, ethnic stereotype. Serves as cultural validation, and to assert social pressures. Blason Populaire - stereotypes. Wandering Jew Ashaver - a fool Cain only ever scavenges, never produces. Machus - struck Jesus or derided him. Kenosis - emptying oneself. Religion and Myth Myths are stories that explore rather than explain. Absolutely no mention of women in their mythology. Myth becomes distinctly biological, and to do with dirt. Theological maps A food that perfectly represents the cosmos - fat? A Widsith diet plan? Seeing if this works? A fad? A table of proto-graph in the mythology? Or indeed a full graph on the part of the Eremite. Accident and mishap is the nature of myth, which always seems to take the most convoluted route to reach the status quo. The splitting of gods - amoeba Often somebody becomes the father of mankind after mankind has already been born. Adoption is culturally basic. A go-between, or is the shaman the furthest removed from the gods? Causes disease or death. Charms and other things to ensure parts of life go on. Philosophy - what do I want to say? The gradual revelation of landscapes Sentient animals Add one element to an existing animal. Everyday and eternal meet The world relies on an infinite resource Qawwali for the music of Loss Repeating utterances What body percussion? What features? Wailing, Wayle, a scholar of the music? Is he the manager? A character? Wayling? A sense of transcendance. What music is this? What is its role? Contacting the Sporots - he makes this error, the Institute picks up on it Love, Fortune, Happiness Tricksters Animal Idols Mythical Beasts Painting The Story Universal Creatures Death And The Underworld Sacred Sites End Of The World Creation Of The World The Cosmos Sun And Moon Making Humankind Supremem Beings Floods And Storms The Elements The Natural World Fertility and Birth Children Of The Gods Ancestor Worship Evil Forces Superheroes Divine Weapons Gods Of War Hagiography - study of saints Religion doesn’t need to have a “use”, anthropologically; what is it for, then?

            <Title>Anthropology</Title>
            <Text>Anthropology is more holistic and detailed. Not interested in universals, but specifics. Do anthropologists have a duty to intervene? Division along tool types - internal to Loss? Do not explain that these people were employed by the Institute or its corrolaries - too easy. Marco Polo, John of Plano Carpini, Abu Rayhan Biruni, Ibn Khaldun, A need to catalogue Are the people of Loss a disease? Are they natural? An anthropological theory. Unilinealism and Diffusionism - societies develop in the same/different ways. Loss is odd in that it is a post-industrial society that does not wish to talk about itself. John Of Plano Carpini Entered the court of Great Khan (1182 - 1252) Companion of Francis of Assissi. Concerned with listing cultural items Part of a Diplomatic mission sent by the Pope. Met Batu the Khan. Tode to Mongolia. “Big river whose name we do not know”. Died of the hardships of his journey. === Often a marginalised area, without as much funding as others. Lloyd Fallers Clifford Geertz Julian Steward Leslie White - Less fieldwork, more book learnin’ Eric Wolf Europe And People Without History Heidegger Derrida Anthropology is explicited tied to the military. Project Camelot Ulf Hannerz Exploring The City Beyond every day Social movements, research, development, how to treat the disease, and how he will not help Torres Strait Islanders visited by anthropologists. Margaret Lawrie visited and recorded their stories - a “good” anthropologist, opposed to the Institute? Alfred Haddon came before. Terra Nullius - This is No-One’s Land E.B Tylor - cultural evolutionism - universal basis for all societies and religions - does Loss disprove this? Not sure. Reintroduced the term “animism” as the basis of all religions. Anthropology as reform Trying to find the societal, developmental “sweet spot?” Poor health sparked travel, and therefore anthropology. This is the basis of the Institute. It redirects the life. (E.B. Tylor never travelled again after that first trip to Mexico). Primtive culture are not devolved, merely uneducated, and cumulation of knowledge is the way forward. This has not helped Loss, however. Customs should be left behind as “baggage” and new ones adopted - Tylor’s “survivals”, vestiges of old, useless customs - Loss has them in spades. Similar to “meme”. Religion is a survival. Modern religion is not advanced, but excludes scientific explanation in order to preserve this “survival” Is climate change affecting them? Project Camelot - Causes of conflicts between national groups. 1964-5 U.S. Army. In order to arm indigenous groups. Exposed in the media. Crysanthemum and the sword came from social research into why Japan had attacked the U.S. Marco Polo’s father left before he was born for a trip around Europe. Set free a Tartar slave in his will - travelled from Asia, linked to the Institute? Dictated in prison - a desperate attempt to fulfill his bargain. Trapped by the Khan in China Two-year voyage - of two hundred only eighteen survived. Meme - a unit of cultural value Analogous to genes Mimeme Always many attempts to discredit writers. Some did not travel widely - used books The story of two messengers, the story of the waxing and waning moon, the story of the serpent and his cast skin, the story of the banana. Their version of English comes without cultural inspirations - what is the cut-off point? Is there this social over-arching? Are they right? Participant observation - immersing yourself in a culture. What is protected and kept backstage? Discrepancies between what they believe happens and what does happen. Self-analysis Life-histories Social interactions are not necessarily indicative of a social structure. What if these people do not really know each other? What if they have been caught in a room together, and are acting as if they know each other to avoid embarrassment? Cultural relativism - no absolutes or ruling guidelines when it comes to societies; they can evolve in any way, easily ridiculously. Also a way to dismiss racial stereotyping and profiling. No a priori experiences. A reaction to Western ethnocentrism - what happens when it is encountered elsewhere? Does the Eremite start to pity them, but reinforce the stereotypes of ethnocentricity after a while, and become a ridiculous figure, a clown wandering through this disaster of his own making. Language is a way to categorise experience, not just communicate ideas. Do some of the Fidgets stay away from culture, to remain ethno-neutral. &quot;What power resides in the object given that causes its recipient to pay it back?&quot; The gift that is not reciptrocated cannot exist as it does not create social ties They fight against microscopic organisms - usually very clean, becoming dirtier in the town? We can give free gifts without realising that they are gifts, or that they are being given. An invisible gift. Griaule criticized for misrepresenting myth of the Dogon people. Is the religious text a facsimile? Dogon people are a comparable source. Ritual separation. Genital multilation? How to figure this? Stick with the qualities of life rather than qualities of history Fieldwork should not alter the environment Most anthropologists have been warriors. Deep Play: A game with stakes so high no rational person engage in it. Is K!K!K! A deep play? Thick description - not just describing the behaviour, but the context as well - “tell don’t show” - the opposite of “good” writing. Are fiction and anthropology opposed. Should the outside be made aware, or is it better to leave them outside ? How do taboos form? Are they part of meme theory? Between memes and not - an autonomy of mind that responds selectively and chaotically to transmitted and disseminated stimuli. Plano Carpini died as a result of his travels Tightly bandaged to endure the rigours of travel. Pass between two flames to burn off bad thoughts - the Eremit efeels nothing “A big river whose name we do not know” What had he eaten as he travelled Did he have a travelling companion? Why was he left behind? More about the sailors that he travelled with. The book of the piece transliterates everything for readers who do not wish to do it themselves, who want something of the experience in book form Can you play it apart from all of the forum talk and workings out? Would it be as fun? Look at the traditional tenets of anthropology - puberty rites, festivals, funerals, births, marriage, war, ceremony, dance etc. How would this develop differently? What can be added to it, or changed? Using one’s flimsy authorityu in comments - both on imgur and in pompeii graffiti; it is universal. A desire to raise oneself above the mass in any situation. Types of graph? “Knew the creator by contemplation of the creature. Was John Mandeville a Fidget? Too far back. Archaisms - “maugre” - few, “briddes” - birds, wrot, tellith, maervilles The lengthy titles How far into this tradition does he want to go? “To teach you the way out of England to Constantinople.” He needs to describe the journey a little more. What does this multi-faceted “ports of light” approach do, in a modern piece? There are many ways to Loss. Such generalities! “You will come to Bulgaria, and a stone bridge. Olive, cedar, palm and cyprus - a puzzle involving these? Smell of rot and the body. A way to teach random facts to people. Wholly wood? Their names need work - too prescriptive. Why do these things protect against such a wide variety? Why would these people live here? Hermogene Strange occurences and diggings up How does he factor all of them? Does his lie run away with him? Seeking a formal structure of a society, or an evolutionary, specific/general relational structure. Technology defines society, which defines ideology, and therefore technology defines culture. Technology “solves the problem of survival” What if the problem was not survival? If you knew that you would live? How would you structure your society? Would it make you better humans? Rates of death/birth A fastidious cataloguing of the town. All the Miasma stuff plugs in - you have something that you can wade through at the end, but not link to: once you discover it and have signed up, it becomes tied to your account. You can share the pages, but they do not become meaningful right away? Is this too restrictive? Energy capture and retention is what defines a society as successful. Energy of muscles - animals - plants - natural resources - nuclear energy - ? P = ET (cultural development = energy x efficiency of use) Technology is all that matters? Is more energy the solution? Or have they passed nuclear? Are there buried reactors underground? Are they a theme park of humans? A museum? Are they ultimately efficient? Deconstruction - can everything in Loss escape this duality? Isn’t this duality what forms life? SHOULD we get rid of it? Values, society, discourse etc. Comes from a web of things meaningless alone, and only given meaning in comparison to others. Derrida tries to fight against this, to expose the oppositions (joined like angry twins), separate them, and create new terms that cannot be joined in the same manner. “Mark” instead of language - everything is meaningful. Pre-linguistic He is looking for an absolute meaning rather than a relational one. In comparison to what has come before and after as well - both diachronic and synchronic Indeterminacy of translation - how can you tell what a word is, where it is broken etc. Without knowledge of the language first? Training in other disciplines Archaeology Are they even a community? Are they drawn from across the world? The forgotten? The shunned? The stupid? Cranial measurements - several as they get more ill. He does not do it properly What role do genetics play? Mouth shapes for the tachygraph The tachygraph NEEDS to be stranger. A go-between with the townspeople - is this Friend? Are they his teachers? He acts the other way around. The Escutcheon - a coat of arms Did the Institute own the Ogden Land Company? A Victorian legacy - a more modern approach to deep-seated superiority - an individual one. A web name - it extends out like a flow diagram. Monogenesis Not Latinate-based Somebody’s path through their house Not an autistic cataloguing, but an attempt to frame his experience. A disposition is where one stands publicly, not ones internal presence Symbolic violence - imposing dominant disposition on the dominant, who then come to see them as “correct” We are creating life here. Symbolic capital and violence - for the game? Symbolic violence against the young - or the old? \ Observing disagreements from the outside Gait, dress, accent How does the school transfer transgression? Transgression becomes the status quo. The young try to destroy it.</Text>

            <Title>Ideas For The Book</Title>
            <Text>- The Eremite’s writings? A nicely produced anthropological document of some of the other places he has been? - I think, in comparison to the work, it has to be a little more sumptuous - straight text just won’t work. - A straight novel? From the perspective of the Eremite? I’m not sure this will be very interesting. You are buying into a world, and it undermines the perspectives of the main project. To have a third-person narration would undermine the world’s establishment, and first-person is too similar to the main document. - The work of the Institute? A wider world? - The diary of another Eremite? Sam North? Following the other Eremite? - I would like it to be able to stand on its own, but to be able to gain more from it if you follow the story. - Codes from it unlock additional content, not necessary, but - But the Kindle market etc. Will I be shutting these guys out? - Written by a hidden character? - A collection of new folk tales? - Well, what about an app on iPad? Or are they keen for low-cost tie-in? If so, I’m not sure that this project is the right thing. - A philosophy text? What would the point of a new book be? Just to make more money? It has to mean something, and not just exist because the project might be successful and therefore it can exist.</Text>

            <Title>Proposed Timetable For Loss Work</Title>
            <Text>This is all preliminary, but I think fairer considering the time outlay that I believe will be required on my part throughout the project: Sign Contract: Start Of October As well as being when my rent is due, this gives a month to come up with a very solid contract, with work beginning immediately. Phase 1 (Writing And Planning): October-Christmas (Extendable) Looking at how much needs to be done, with not just the Miasma content but the structuring of the office content, marketing, the music, photography etc. (please see separate list) I think that three months of full-time work on this is reasonable, if still a little optimistic. I can work like the clappers if I need to, but I have felt that there has been an underestimation of how much the text needs to be expanded, reconfigured, and in parts rewritten for this format. I can see this extending into January or Feburary, but the only break I am taking in this time is from 13th-20th October, and it is essentially a working holiday, so I will still be available and writing, if interspersed by bike rides and swimming. To be pessimistic, let us say that this period extends to the start of Feburary, which is five months to prepare all of the initial marketing, write up all of the Miasma content, create the art/3D models, produce the music and recordings, set up the bulk of the initial office content, and be ready for the next phase. Phase 2 (Rolling Out): Feburary-March/April This is in line with your initial plan, with a month of promotion, and user engagement, with me writing new stuff if needed, looking at trends, and engaging with readers and other outlets. A month is not a very long time, especially for something that is quite slow-burning like this, so what would you say to two months? I know Alexus may think this is too long, however. Phase 3 (Extending The Content): March/April-May/June I think a further two months of writing new content and integrating it into the initial system, as well as drilling down and resolving story arcs and other loose ends, might take a little more than two months, but I am hoping that the workflow will be by that point streamlined and take less time administratively. Around this time I think, if it is going well, we should start thinking about the accompanying book. Waiting till then will peak more interest and reach more players, but still be in the early stages (meaning that most people will still be engaging with this world). Perhaps it could come a little earlier, but I think time-wise there will be more time to write it in the summer. This also spreads out payment for me, which I like. Phase 4 (?): June/July Onwards If I am honest, I do not have a clear idea of what will happen after this initial period. It may be that the project is completely self-contained, and we find a way to archive it so that it does not require hundreds of active players to be fun for others (This is something that I think is key to the project as a whole). It may be that we continue to add content, in a way that extends the experience, or start something in the same universe but with an entirely different format and narrative. I’m not sure. I think my main opposition comes from the statement that after Phase 2 I will not have a lot of input, and therefore payment only needs to reflect 6 months work. - The initial phase will run to nearly this amount any way. - From what Alexis has said, most of the content creation and implementation will be by me alone, and so I will be doing this throughout every phase. - Any extension that takes place will require extra work. - I do understand that this is extending into an unknown. I believe that: a) payment needs to accurately reflect the amount of work over the amount of time I will be doing it. B) Make provisions for if things are delayed, work overruns, etc. With these factors in place, work can continue until the point that we reach that unknown, at which point a further contract can be drafted to cover work that is created in the light of any success this project has I.e. Drastically extending content. It also should be said that some of this content will not be makeable by me: it would be good to bring an artist on board who can help me with it. This is something that will need to be talked about for the contract.</Text>

            <Title>New Notes</Title>
            <Text>Best graphics are a player’s imagination. 
Disability? Text descriptions read by mellifluous voice actors?
Letters look like animals
A lack of imagination amongst primitives
Their language based around hatred of the sea - sibilance is evil, here, too, as it sounds like the waves?
The weapon letters - only used for insults? 
Later letters, for modern things? What is their genealogy and history? Where did these “conveniences” come from?
Sound? How many uses of feedback are there?
Dale/Vale/Coombe/Coomb/Coon/Kloof
What sediment does it deposit?
Muggy - regulates temperature with humidity.
Is it a hanging valley?
Interested in those animals which shape their world - as celebrants of mysteries, those animals which they cannot see are even more important.
Giving animals human attributes which are desirable. 
We do this to this day. 
Animals from outside the valley drawn incorrectly - she calls him an elephant - is this figured in the bestiary? 
Downsteam - a mythical place of death and hell
Upstream - the font of knowledge - they are the filters
Minerology, botany, medicine
THey can only describe it as being parts of animals they had seen, or already factored - how can this change? Describe as one thing. 
An x+y=z approach - what can things be combined with? A sense of entrenched immutability, or exciting experimentation?
All societies are information societies
A fictional framework in which they can place themselves.
Media is a way to mediate human relations, anthropologically
So little direct experience of cannibalism happening - a barely believable threat.
Eating of infected brain tissue - the spreading of prions.
Choice, complicity, consequence: Emotional, moral, mechanical, strategic, personally expressive.
What other kinds of choice are there?
Necessary, unnecessary, binary, illusory, multiple-choice, veiled, open, gamble, 
Complicity - the immediate dramatic reward of making a choice. The agency that is lacking in other media. 
Consequence - immediate, or reverberated.
Don’t just use consequence. The others are important as well. 
Bestiaries had primarily an English audience. 
The bestiary taken out by many hands - why?
If it is not to moralise, what is it for? To instruct, to lie, to console, to entertain, 
SHOULD the animals be symbolic?
Don’t want to fool people - create an alternative, a richness, a texture. 
How close do those without science look at the outside world?
Books are random-access - the web even more so. 
Short narratives - how can I use this to my advantage? The limited set.
How many endings?
How many paths?
Visualisations
How can we do this? 
Reference books are random access
Hopscotch approach
Spatial representation is much better.
First ending is a dire one. 
Bring in player psychology as to who will choose which page. 
Directed graph
Can you go back? Cannot do that in adventure books. 
Win the story - find the best ending. 
Endings in the age of Mass Effect
Diverging paths before returning to the main one. 
The addition of vernacular detail to scenes from history. 
The “watchers” at the periphery of the painting.
Crowd-source the artwork as it is too expensive to produce outselves.
Holding animals - do they hold at arm’s length? 
A crusader? 
Titillation  - religious scenes (pagan) provide a chance to paint nudes
Spiral designs
People ragging on books - they are looking at it in the wrong way.
A description of the coat of arms - not like anything that they have seen before. Where have they recieved this tradition from? 
Comparisons of poems

The visibility of the land around you
What does a valley as opposed to islands? What does it do to the psychology
Finite State Machine
Territory, spheres of influence, scenarios
Stylised paintings of people - like musical instruments. 
The distribution of water is very important - they never wash. 
Concrete looks like it was created by too perfect a race - not us. 
They get their ideas, ways of speaking, and political persuasion from ephemera that float down the mountain. 
In a valley, nothing can blow away. An island and peak - moves everything away, nothing stays for too long. A new landscape; a valley is an old one.

            <Title>Valley Notes</Title>
            <Text>A valley seals in decay. Wherever the eyes look, there is only rock, joined to the earth by its entirety. It disallows expansion, keeping a civilisation, drawn there by thirst and fear of the outside, hemmed in and unable to move in the way that is intended. Light is either trapped or does not penetrate, and nothing on the flat is illuminated for observation. It is only the slopes, and the promise of escape. 

Of course, this does make some people feel safe. Nothing comes to the valley, because of its high walls, they think. We are safe. Unfortunately, you cannot tell water that it cannot come to dinner. It bought that flat sog that would become the valley, many histories before you thought a spine was possible. It laid down roots, it drilled and sucked, and brought a little oxygen to the rock. 

THE SEA —&gt; the sea is the conclusion of all water. No matter how clean the spring, it will gather up everything it can, and hurtle downhill, under hill, through bridge, sometimes put to sleep for the journey in great silvery dormitories. This progressions means the end of all that has gone before. The sea means death, change, fear, and the unknown. The people of the town fear the sea for its exposure to the gods, its emptiness, and the idea that one is sent there to die, right at the borders of life. For the young, and for the Eremite, the sea is a customs house for transformation; into a sailor, an adventurer. For those who are too old, be they an entire people or just one person, the sea is a wall against which you are pushed. It affords you a glimpse of what you are promised; blue, infinity; and rings it tarnished with other, worldly things; flies on seaweed, the tiny dicks of worms, crabs upturned to be loved by seagulls. 

Everything wants to go to entropy - the valley catches the refuse, defies that wish.

A valley breeds out all knowledge or remembrance of the sea. It contains the least sky, the least water, often, of any landscape. It holds tradition and history like a clam on seaweed, ways of doing things, people in a false aristocracy. Where good breeding means the loneliest people one can imagine.

            <Title>Sketch Of The Town's Coat of Arms</Title>
            <Text>This is a sketch, in a detailed hand, of the town’s sigil, or coat of arms. Accompanying Note Opposite is a composite drawing that I completed over several days in my room and on the street; the town's crest seems to always be in the most distant or troublesome spot. Much was guesswork, though I believe that I received the elements correctly; the black crown I cannot guess at, though the key is a real object, kept by the Mayor, a symbolic fetish that I was given to hold on my first day here. The turkey dragon is a disgusting yet beloved creature native to these parts, and the beetroot something of a national crop, if Loss can be considered a nation; it certainly has no betters or rulers other than itself. The ball at lower right refers to a piece of equipment from K!K!K! (see my earlier notes) and in the centre is a banjo or zither-type instrument, though its shape is suggestive and seems to draw giggles from the children who play catch in the fountain where one such crest is located. The colours are so vibrant and omnipresent, brought out in tempera, that I attempted to replicate them myself, though I must apologise about their quality; the only medium I had were colouring pencils from the school. Features - This coat of arms is like nothing that he has ever seen before.

            <Title>Miasma Content Introduction</Title>
            <Text>MIASMA CONTENT Unified Features OPEN WEBSITES The Miasma content consists of open websites - no sign-up is required, no login or password, to view them. This means that these pages are shareable openly between everyone. However, the URLs should be obfuscated, and not obvious, but contain some logic behind them, so that a very determined player can work out their provenance, and find others that way. VARIED CONTENT The scope of each should be varied: some should be small, Tchotchkes of text or genera interest, some can seem minor but instead be very important, some are merely flavour, some are puzzles and connect directly to the game, and others are puzzles of text, as in any piece of writing. The object’s affordances, both perceived and actual, should be tinkered with to produce the correct result. Everything ties into the game, or references it, and clues should swing both back and forth. If we have time, we will expand into representing information in other ways, yet obscuring or at least making it multi-interpretation: graphs, diagrams, tables, and other quantifications of data. FUEL FOR DISCUSSION These pieces draw people into the world, and their obscurity and interpretative nature means that they will drive discussion as well, further fuelled by sharing and dispersal. They will pull people into the game, as well. VARIED MECHANICS AND FUNCTIONALITY As well as being readable and manipulable, some of the objects will have hidden or non-obvious functionality (especially the 3D models), such as time-based puzzles, hidden areas or mechanics, codes, glitches, quizzes and other pieces. This will drive further collaboration to solve pieces, and unlock their function. Some pieces may have more than one function, and may relate to more than one part of the story. UNIFIED DESIGN Each piece, within the fiction, belongs to the Widsith Institute, and so this should be represented on each piece by a logo, or a small piece of text at the bottom of each page. These should link to the game or the Institute’s website (which, I am feeling increasingly, should be one and the same. The design should be visually, aurally and tactically appealing, to draw players in to a “richness” of world. DISPERSED, EPHEMERAL NATURE As ergodic literature, it is vital that there is no one way to traverse the text, and that it is never trivial. Different ways of collating the text will result in different interpretations. Occasionally, text may be changed, though people may be warned of this, giving them a chance to conduct some form of version control. DRIVE TO ACQUIRE Players should want these items. They have a use, a link to the world, a mystery, a physical appeal - everything about them should scream “take me, hold me, I matter to you. You should keep me.” TWO DATING SYSTEMS Each piece of Miasma Content uses one of two systems - either the Eremite’s, or the Institute’s. Both are different codes, and work in different ways, and in most cases the latter edits out the former. They are usually meticulously dated, and while they relate to real chronological progression, in order to allow players some way into this system, both are significantly removed from it. Options For Construction HTML 5 and WebGL, Photoshopped images, Youtube or custom video player for audio and video (reskinned to suit the feel of the world), Touchpress for 3D models. Length As per discussions, 25-30 pieces of Miasma Content is plenty for players to get their heads around. However, I am not sure if this should include all the straight text, as there is rather more of this. If each piece of text is no more than 500 words, then there will be significantly more than this - maybe as many as 50. However, the workload does not increase significantly, as much of this will be plain text with minor Photoshop work. The full list of Miasma Content, broken down into type, is to come. I do, however, not want to produce too much content, or on the reverse create too little. If a player spends 60 hours in the game I would like part of that to be spent soaking up the environment, not pursuing active, mechanical tasks that are merely “filler”, such as side-missions in videogames. Features Of The Writing - He uses ligature to denote certain parts of the text. Ligature is used to evolve language, to make it more efficient but perhaps make less sense, and evolve symbologies of their own. They speed up writing. - He is part of the “Great Scrapbook” tradition, in which he tries to frame his experience using other people’s work, stuck together by his own spittle, as if he were a bird who needs a nest.</Text>

            <Text>THE LOSS SURVIVOR’S CABAL ORCHESTRA Features A Live Band - Performers who represent the last survivors of the Loss Town Orchestra, brought into the real world to perform for reasons unknown. Meta Concerns - At first, we will only have time to produce recorded music, after having hinted at the songs throughout the initial release of the project. Eventually, however, I would like to move on to live gigs, with a “manager” character called Wayle, who appears in the game and leaves the Institute to start organising gigs. - There will be clues for fans at the gigs. - They have to be petitioned to get people to perform the songs of the youth, in a ritualistic fashion, every time they gig. - Players may be able to act as security at a gig for an in-game benefit. Downloads - The music, when available, is free to anyone who has spent any Nex on the game. Aesthetic - Smartly dressed. - They wear masks, influenced by the artwork of the town. Influences Qawwali - Devotional, droning, very long, a trance state. Body Percussion - Using oneself as an instrument. This ties into the mythology of town, and the representation of the townsfolk in art. Repetition - Ritualism is key here.</Text>

            <Title>Audio Recordings Introduction</Title>
            <Text>AUDIO RECORDINGS

Unified Features

VARIETY OF CONTENT
The recordings will vary in both quality and style, ranging from interviews, to songs, to field recordings, to speeches, to epistolary entries, to reminders, to other ephemera. They can either be embedded into Miasma Content that already exists, or stand on their own as a piece of “evidence”.

NO DRM
I think that, given that they are ostensibly free anyway, we should allow people to download these recordings in whatever format they choose. This allows them to distribute them, remix them, take them apart, and otherwise allows us to embed other puzzles into them. 

LOW BUDGET
Given the low budget set aside for the Miasma Content, the audio recordings need to be kept short, low budget, and easily reproducible. This can usually be achieved by having them be of a low quality, with many aural artefacts. I may in fact buy some old audio equipment with which to record these sections, and conduct this independently of Random House, unless they can allocate some funds for it. 

RESKINNED
We can use a standard player, but for little effort we can reskin it to make it look like a Widsith player, or even that belonging to the Eremite, a large musical “box.” This could come within the game element.

Features

- The townspeople speak in a certain way, related in his writing. On record, this is distorted somehow, into a high-pitched keening, or an extremely low register. Whatever we decide on, it should be very different from the Eremite when on record.

            <Title>Considerations - The Town</Title>
            <Text>THE TOWN

General

- The town is an allegory for several things, including:
1) itself;
2) my own philosophy;
3) The Institute (its diametric opposite).
- It is a community that has moved from an “elevated” state to a base state. Its absurdity contains a kind of honesty, in its adherence to literalist, dogmatic materialism.
- Unlike the reference in the Kindle piece, its placement is entirely accidental, if symbolic. It sits on the great river, “That Whose Name We Do Not Know”, which filters ideas and ideology, like all valleys, but in a far more literal way. 
- They are most definitely NOT aliens. There have been plenty of hints that way so far. They are a society learning how to exist. They have not been there long. Embarrassment at knowing each other. Very few of them live together. 
- They damn imported goods - people come and leave it in the valley. They are ideal to be the focus of a charity. 
- They are like as children.
- It is a mystery as to how it can support itself. 
- They find it odd that humans group together for comfort - stand in groups, the “barbeque philosophy”. Especially families, fathers and sons.
- Their “information society” is broken. 
- The town is, in a way, a stage for the Eremite; he is presented with a very limited view of life there, despite his best efforts to be omnipresent and act as its surrogate deity. Is there a way for the audience to be aware of what is kept, as it were, “backstage” from him? This would obviously integrate into the OC initially, but would then be applicable to missing portions of the MC, and also the reader’s understanding.
- They are decaying into mongoloids, having accepted the disease. 
- It is an interesting question as to why they would live here - surely they could make a choice to live somewhere else? Outside of the valley? 
- The town stands for febrility biology and the fall of all ascension into mundanity and bodily needs.
- There has to be a breach in the valley’s wall of silence. How does information get in and out? 
- The town is meant to be a demonstration of how to progress society without changing it fundamentally.
- The Execution Venn provides an interesting philosophical problem. One can choose to die without guilt or incrimination, and others can choose for themselves which category into which they will fit. 

Water

- Fermentation vs. Distillation; the townsfolk are terrified of ideas sticking. However, given the “stickiness” of existence, this is impossible to avoid. The valley invites water to stay. Gravity is both their ally and hated foe, being what brought them from the heavens, but which also helps them move water. Water, funnily, would be the only thing that could wash away the “ideas” of which they speak. 
- The sea is a move to ascension, back to their past, and this is why they hate it. It also resembles Loss in information. But that information can be in the air around, and in fact becomes so. 
- Ritual is linked to cooking, fecundity, the earth and body.
- They do not wash, and this leads them to believe that rot drives away the gods, when in fact it attracts them. Water in the earth needs to be dried out, and nobody is buried.
- We are pushed from the center as we get older, to die - this is why they hate the sea - ends up in an old folk’s home by the sea - did not die, as they said?
- They are even scared of the fluids in their bodies. They never wash, and the distribution of water (for example, in the canals) is tightly controlled. They love the sound of it, but cannot attach it to the physical thing that they hate (when heard in isolation).
- They are called Loss because something is lost by their interference in the stream of information. 
- Dams are the interpretation of a river. Battle with them over generations. 
- They never take their clothes off - they are the clothes that they were found in

Women

- I am not sure what women’s role is, yet. I do want a Christian doctrine of original sin, a hatred for falling, nor a complete empowerment, ala Willdorf.
- Perhaps gender is not much of an issue, especially in a town which is peopled by strangers. 
- DEATH OF A FRIEND’S FATHER IS HER LOVER - they met together, and assumed that they were family. 

Folklore

- Their relationship with folklore is different - how?
- Their gods stand apart from this tradition - they cannot get them wet, lest they bond with the ideas and disappear.
- The statues are sealed diseases.
- As a people, they are dying. 
- They have some relics of their descension, problems that they take for granted, such as the removal of buildings and the use of hidden machinery that he never sees. He thinks he hears them, but is told, “it is only the ground you hear”.
- Nobody dreams in the town, and dreams are never described. 
- Were they washed down into the valley?
- Nothing is buried, not even bodies - “we will not be here long.” They cannot leave anything behind. They have a cultural anxiety about always being ready to leave. This is so absurd, surely - just go! 
- They become the gods, with these diseases - as do the employees of the Institute. 
- Much ritual relies on the passage of time - it will sort itself out, one way or another, while the ritual is performed.
- The wisdom of their ancestors is false, and so it comes across piecemeal and full of error. 
- Their religion makes it sound as if they are aliens. They did not literally come down from the sky - where would they have come from, relating to the other peculiarities of the place?
- People in the town become smaller to become more energy-efficient. This, of course, brings them back towards the ideal of their gods. 
- Where do they go for rituals? Holes in the ground?

Architecture And Geography

- The houses get thinner as the people get thinner, losing rooms and becoming grief-stricken.
- “The big river whose name we do not know” - the river is not named, and the reason for this must be forcibly hinted at. 
- The town is laid out to be a slowly-unwrapped revelation - which is strange, as they recieve no visitors, and must presumably all have explored it. 
- The library is huge, but with only a small handful of adventure books in it. 
- The picture of Abraham Lincoln in the Hotel is linked to the story about him. 
- That the facades of buildings are blank reveals the limits of his imagination.
- Their ruins are follies. Their states reflect a message. 

Clothing And Stance

- The wearing of hideous organic material on the breast.
- Yanki zuwari - squatting japanese-style - is there a way of posing that is distinctly Lossian?

Names

Details

- Burning Resin
- They begin to tax neighbours for their dead compatriots.
- Someone in the town wears gas for clothing.
- Mutilation of themselves and others.
- Things to consider - Puberty rites, festivals, funerals, births, marriage, war, ceremony, dance, gait, dress, accent. 
- Ruins
- Grotesque incidents
- Who is sleeping together?
- Power? Where do they get?
- How do the buildings and machinery move?
- Where do they get their water?
- Lots of things need fixing - an impossible task
- What is down the river?
- Cutlery?
- Flora?

Language

- What is their style of English called? New English? Retarded English? It comes without cultural aspiration.
- The letters could look like animals, be closely-packed, atypical and alogical writing.
    - Their language based around hatred of the sea - sibilance is evil, here, too, as it sounds like the waves?
    - The weapon letters - only used for insults? 
    - Later letters, for modern things? What is their genealogy and history? Where did these “conveniences” come from?
    - Sound? How many uses of feedback are there?
    - Its morphemes - how can they be rendered?
    - Pictograms -&gt; ideograms - radical-radical compounds 

   Bestiary

   - Grass Mud Horse
   - Those animals which shape the world are most important, like the animals which they cannot see. 
   - The pages are stained and thumbed many times. 
   - They can only describe it as being parts of animals they had seen, or already factored - how can this change? Describe as one thing. 
   - If it is not to moralise, what is it for? To instruct, to lie, to console, to entertain, 
   - SHOULD the animals be symbolic?

	Romance And Relationships

	- They do not really know each other, and are too embarrassed to say.

Unified Features

COMMENTARY
This is an overlain commentary from the initial Widsith Institute investigation, from before the player gets their hands on the Miasma Content. They have an official air, and refer to case notes, other pieces of evidence, the veracity of the claims, as well as sometimes providing hints for the player. 

DATING SYSTEM AND STAR MAPS
Each piece penned by the Eremite has its own dating system, as well as a bar of painting at the top of it, a diagram of the night sky when he was writing, as he only writes at night. These are part of his own calculations to try and place Loss somewhere within the world. This sits to the side of the star maps, like a seal, or perhaps on both sides. 

MARGINALIA
This is tied to the “Horror Vacui” feature below, but the Eremite is quite fond of marginalia, and employs it often in his own work. He has a distinctive hand, and at times, others have got hold of his notebook, and added their own marginalia - they each have their own signifiers, hands and styles, to distinguish them. This is full of philosophical puzzles, as well as the main text. 

SEVERAL VOICES, ONE AUTHORITY
The Eremite is not the only voice here; townspeople speak also. He may have edited their words, but his words in turn are edited by the Institute, and theirs, therefore, is the only authority. He does use direct quotation, and the writings of others, but rarely, loving the sound of his own voice too much.

HORROR VACUI
The Eremite fully embraces this quality; however, it is not so much fear that he feels, but compulsion based in this belief of the importance of his words. He must fill every surface he has because of his faith in posterity, and how his words will be pored over. The writing is densely packed, filling every available inch of page, in all directions. 

RUNIC SYSTEM
This is perhaps a future feature, but one that I would like to implement at an early stage. The Eremite has a series of runes that he uses to identify different parts of his work. At the moment, the secret behind these is that they stand for paths that can be taken through the story, but I would like to start implementing these and giving hints that they may be important at a future date. 

EMERGING OBSESSION
This refers to the eventual and growing number of chemical diagrams in the margins of the Eremite’s entries, as he tries to work out whether he has infected the town. These are nuanced, and grow almost imperceptibly in frequency and severity. 

LETTER ENLARGEMENT
Certain letters are enlarged in the text - there is a logic behind this. Which letters are important is tied not really to their type but their placement, in the island style.

“A valley seals in decay. Wherever the eyes look, there is only rock, joined to the earth by its entirety. It disallows expansion, keeping a civilisation, drawn there by thirst and fear of the outside, hemmed in and unable to move in the way that is intended. Light is either trapped or does not penetrate, and nothing on the flat is illuminated for observation. It is only the slopes, and the promise of escape. 

Of course, this does make some people feel safe. Nothing comes to the valley, because of its high walls, they think. We are safe. Unfortunately, you cannot tell water that it cannot come to dinner. It bought that flat sog that would become the valley, many histories before you thought a spine was possible. It laid down roots, it drilled and sucked, and brought a little oxygen to the rock. 

THE SEA —&gt; the sea is the conclusion of all water. No matter how clean the spring, it will gather up everything it can, and hurtle downhill, under hill, through bridge, sometimes put to sleep for the journey in great silvery dormitories. This progressions means the end of all that has gone before. The sea means death, change, fear, and the unknown. The people of the town fear the sea for its exposure to the gods, its emptiness, and the idea that one is sent there to die, right at the borders of life. For the young, and for the Eremite, the sea is a customs house for transformation; into a sailor, an adventurer. For those who are too old, be they an entire people or just one person, the sea is a wall against which you are pushed. It affords you a glimpse of what you are promised; blue, infinity; and rings it tarnished with other, worldly things; flies on seaweed, the tiny dicks of worms, crabs upturned to be loved by seagulls. 

Everything wants to go to entropy - the valley catches the refuse, defies that wish.

A valley breeds out all knowledge or remembrance of the sea. It contains the least sky, the least water, often, of any landscape. It holds tradition and history like a clam on seaweed, ways of doing things, people in a false aristocracy. Where good breeding means the loneliest people one can imagine.

Its placement is never an accident.”

In a valley, nothing can blow away. An island and peak - moves everything away, nothing stays for too long. A new landscape; a valley is an old one.

            <Title>Entry 1 - Arrival</Title>
            <Text>(Throughout this journal entry are streaks of dirt, tiny maps of mountain passes, sketches of streams and paths, as well as astrological calculations. One of these paths is labelled “To Return”). My left toe felt as if it was nearly severed at the root; my boots were nothing more than Greek wrappings, and I had used all of my balm yoghurt to colour the heat in my joints. My pack was heavy, my memorabilia falling to dust occasionally when I had not affixed them well enough. I had to leave Eligius' Throat next to the den of some warrening beast, to let it roll with forest lice and spiders, poisoning them forever now that it was free from its lead sheath. Jenny's pendant, also, gave me bad dreams in the hammock. They had both had their use. The rock rose around me, filled with a marvellous Cretaceous sparkle; I had seen rock like that all over the world, but it was beautiful nonetheless. I had not worn my mask in days, having met no-one on the road, but the maps told me that the entrance to the valley was near, though I found no tracks, no depressions of carts or cattle, nor any shrine or signpost that would reveal my location. I was nervous of acquainting with others; I had only the furrowed recordings of my own voice and those of the hallooing sailors to keep me company, and even then I thought that the water had got to them, and the voices were warping worse; now they are gone completely, as if I had never taken that voyage. Looking at my maps it appears that I turned into a wide caldera burrowed into the mountains, filled with wildgrass and trees; the map shows tiny conifers that I have drawn, though they could have been of any order; I remember only their shade and the small lagoon dropped amongst them, the water springing from the surrounding rock as if Moses had passed. I lapped at the pool on my knees; the sea air had rubbed my hands and throat raw. I believe that I seated myself, unslung my Tarot harp and began to play. It was completely tuneless, though I managed to wrestle a short arpeggio from it, one that ended in a flourish that, I hoped, would stave off rain and make the sticky day pass swiftly into night. My food was all gone, and so I ate small berries that grew hanging over the water; they were earthy but sweet, the pits flabby and pink. There was no life that I could see in the pool, and it was a metallic blackness, the shade was so extreme; those three colours, the cordial, acid green of the foliage, the black of the water and the hideous white of that blistering road have stayed with me. At this point I heard voices, though to me they must not have been voices, but rather the sound of water pouring, or the creak of machinery, or the crunch of stone on stone. But voices they became, a man and a boy, speaking in halting Queen's English, about the weather of all things! It was like Gibraltar, and seeing a policeman patrolling in shorts for the first time, tugging on his hot war helmet. I quickly donned my mask, and turned to greet them; one lone literanaut against some void of high air. The sight I presented must have quite amazed them, as the man stood stock still, transfixed, whilst the boy screamed and ran back the way they had come. The man was tall and fair, wearing simple cloth garments with few adornments, and he possessed a rather impressive cleft palate, drool swinging pendulous under his chin as he stopped. There was a definite rumour of the endogamist about that palate. He hastily wiped himself and I called to him, happy to be speaking my mother tongue after so many years amongst foreigners. He stepped forward tentatively, dropping the felling axe and sack that materialised from behind his broad shoulders, and stuck a shaking finger towards me. What if I had known, in hindsight, that the first words to be uttered to me by a man of Loss would be, “Where is your mouth, sir?” After I had gingerly pulled at the seals of my mask to show him that I was no ghoul, he inched forward, gave a short curtsey, and introduced himself as Flood Last Year. This was my first encounter with the curious nomenclature of the people of this valley, and in all my studies I had found nothing to prepare me for it. I asked him what it meant, and he replied that “his father had been a man of hate, and of his wife and children he could find no greater punishment.” I had no way to answer him, so I stepped forward, offering chocolate, until I stood very close to him. He smelt of dry-shaving, and was extremely nervous, tapping his fingers against his chest and clicking his tongue to some beat I could not hear. I told him that I was a friend, and that I had come a long way to find his town. His manner completely changed to one of derision; I remember him laughing at me, asking me to remove my mask, reaching around me to adjust my pack, and finally telling me that I would most likely be turned away, and maybe killed for my efforts. I replied that I was not afraid of death, and he hooted at me, ran his finger up the Orinoco of his lip, and told me he would make me tea, and that he was not good for much more. He turned and led me back to what I took to be his home, a little way down the slope and off the track; he was a forester, and his abode, doubling as a tannery for skins and a smoke-house for wood, was a vaulted, thatched affair, of many floors, reaching into the canopy and erupting steam and effluvia from every opening. What struck me most, arriving amongst the dappled ferns and rabbit warrens, was the great copper kiln that was protruded from one side of the hut; it was the likeness of an obese woman, her breasts drooping to form a lid for the fire within. A great priapic extension stuck out underneath the flames, a sort of tap. He saw me looking, and told me it was his Mother Kiln. He rubbed one of the hose-like nipples, the copper worn to silvery opal with generations of gropings, and took me inside. Long, purple furs and puckered beds of sharp scales hung from every wall on long poles, sloughed off or cut from some great reptile. The smell was utterly appalling, and I was surprised that Flood, as he asked me to call him, did not also reek. Every wall was covered with racks of knives, purgatives and strigil, as well as what I took to be wineskins, but were more likely acids and curatives for his trade. Ladders disappeared up into the higher quarters, though a large hole ran through the centre of the building, allowing smoke from the large central fire to drift skywards. The floor was bare earth, and in one corner was a pile of tiny carved limbs, obviously broken from some larger statue, and tossed irreverently to the ground. The frightened boy whom I had seen earlier was cowering in that corner, playing with the bands of his clothing. Flood ordered the lad to greet me as a guest. The boy rose as bidden, and approached me and kissed me full on the air filter; I flinched in shock, and the boy shrieked again and took to his den. He was ill, Flood told me, and his father had asked him to be brought to the woods to get some work done. He tossed him a knife, and the lad began carving at the rear of a large sheepskin, patterned with dots and whorls like a bitten nail. A true Occidental stupidity. I wished to be away, I think, as quickly as possible; a backwoods rube, even a friendly one, could irreparably damage my first impressions of the place I had travelled so far to see. After I had picked out the bitter leaves he had given me in a broth (I imagine, from his interest, to see if I could drink through my mask) I asked him to take me into the town, at which I was warned it was a three hour ride to the gates alone; at my insistence, we trekked for half a mile or so down the path, leaving the boy behind to his work, and came upon another small clearing in the wood ringed with monoliths of smooth shale; I was surprised at this, because of the obvious difficulty at bringing such material from the coast. In the centre of the cairn were a pair of bovine-looking steeds, heavy with one thick horn like a dull serrated knife extending down their backs that pulled their heads up. I had thought them contemplating the heavens when we arrived, though they remained so for our entire journey, peering up at me as if I had told a bad joke. On the horns were daubed the hand-prints of children and long,waved lines. They smelt pleasant enough for livestock, almost like healthy soil, or celery, and around their feet was long hair that trailed on the ground such as that of a prize poodle, though the fur was matted and rife with lice. Flood helped me onto the beast's wide, palanquin-like back and set off at the pace of a canal-boat or a procession through tight streets. Flood controlled his with his hands wrapped around its stomach, clicking ferociously in its ear; mine was kept in line with occasional slaps and prods. The road was full of rebuffs and sharp bends, and despite my pleas for silence so as to nurse my aching backside in peace, Flood probed me with questions about the world, and where I had been. I gave non-committal responses, little more than grunts. I was careful not to ask him too much about his home; I wanted to hear such accounts from educated people, people that I was assured (here a short section of words is ruled through) in Loss. I do feel bad for Flood; he was a simple, ugly fellow, seemingly a member of some caste unknown to me even now, and I perhaps should have been more courteous with my discoverer. Shortly after I arrived he disappeared back into the woods and the mountains, and no-one will tell me anything about his health or destination, nor that of the boy. I have still not been introduced to his father. Perhaps I was too harsh, though at the time I had sincerely hoped that his degeneration was not symptomatic of his people. I have simply written in my notebook that “perhaps all the beautiful did fall at Troy”. The first words after his introdcution are very important - “who’s there?” “Where is your face” - a sneeze - they hint at his later involvement, maybe the infection, and what he truly is. A philosophical crossroads.</Text>

            <Title>Tarot Harp</Title>
            <Text>This is the instrument of the Eremite, rendered in a digital format. It is an “improvisational participation engine”, providing a way to play the music puzzles if one is not a musician. Description - It has the basic form of an autoharp, but it has been heavily modified. It is much larger, with ornate buttons and levers all over it. - It is battered, dirty, caulked in mud. - One panel is missing, exposing the inside of the body. Features - The harp is fully rotatable, and every angle may be seen. - If the players zoom in on the broken panel, they see a very small, ripped label that says “C.F. Zimmerman Shifter, 1886” - There is a ship at sea carved into one corner of the Harp. - There are two points of input; the chord buttons, and the strings. Pressing a chord button before pressing the strings changes their sound. There are 3 chord buttons, and 15 strings. - Both the chord buttons and the strings are labelled. The chord buttons are labelled: Crisis Road Stars And the strings are labelled: Sword Key Raven Lake Chest Monk Beast Hero Cloak Elder Castle Pipes Princess Pauper Blood - When initially discovered, the strings make a disonant, untuned sound, as if they have not been stored well for some time. However, if a player has a certain item in his inventory in the Office Content, is logged in, and accesses the harp, it plays properly, having been tuned and cleaned. - On the reverse of the harp is found a poem, written in the Eremite’s handwriting on the same parchment, and affixed with thick glue: I will scan, iron muscle I will guess, bowel rustle I will run, voice giver I will love, tune shiver I will jump, finger lover I will sing, hole mother I will tell, story seeker You will know, I weaker. - The harp is accompanied by a Widsith note: Artefact Report 98238923JJ:// Loss File Item 12 Argus: The Tarot Harp Scriber: T.W.A.I.N. One C.F. Zimmerman 1886 5-bar “Shifter” model autoharp. Miscellaneous elements damage, salt rot, abrasion consistent with ijolite erosion. Strings have not been replaced since manufacture. Customised with extended cavity, tuning schema and rear-sided paint palette built directly into back plate. Personal Notes: He seems to have customised the instrument for his own purposes: what do these demarcations on the notes and chord buttons signify? He calls it the Tarot Harp; figures here do not represent traditional tarot arcana.</Text>

            <Title>Gas Mask</Title>
            <Text>This is the Eremite’s gas mask. Description - It is mounted as if it were a stag’s head, on a wooden board in same shape as the town’s Escutcheon. - It has a hugely inflated cranial area, and seems to be supported internally by struts. - It is the colour of grey bone. - Two long hoses droop down from the nose, one of which ends in a calcified mess that looks like limescale at the bottom of a kettle. - The words “AHEM ATUM” have been written above the joins of each of the hoses. The word “AHEM” appears above the calcified hose, and “ATUM” above the other. - The accompanying Widsith note contains a biohazard symbol. Features - If the gas mask is turned around, the player can see a short poem written around the inside of the neck seal: “WHOSOEVER BREAKS ME WILL BREATHE MY BREATH AND SEE WHAT I SEE.” - By clicking the gas mask in certain places, the player can remove it from its stand and put it on: this fills the screen with two small circles of light. This, in turn, begins an audio recording that is procedurally generated, and lasts for many hours if the mask is left on. After a long time, they hear a short phrase.</Text>

            <Text>Feasibility Report (Torn Pages Pasted In Journal) (The town's seal is depicted here). THE TOWN OF LOSS TOWN HALL COMMITTEE OFFICIAL DOCUMENT EYES CLOSED, OR FIND REPOSE Feasibility Report 12 February 6th AN APPRAISAL CONCERNING THE REASONABLE ADMITTANCE OF ONE “JOHN CABOOT”, A TRAVELLER, AND ACCESS OF THE TOWN THEREOF, FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD (EQUALLING NO MORE THAN SIX MONTHS) FOR THE PURPOSE OF RESEARCH Report Made and Signed By: Death By Strange Light, Liaison To The Town Hall and Master of Phylacteries This report, to be delivered to the committee this Spring First in the Year That Crocus Blossomed For The First Time Amongst The Brubbage Ribs, must make clear that the man such as this John Caboot, who even now is installed patiently, I must confess, on our borders, must be requested to leave peacefully. He poses a danger to our health, our way of life and the base sanctity of our community. I must respectfully impeach that he is removed at the earliest opportunity. I was amongst those that witnessed this man ride down into the valley along with one of the woodcutters. His appearance, to say the least, was frightening and unwelcoming; a long vestment, high peasant sandals for riding, his haversack stuffed full with dangerous shapes, a strange wooden augur at his side clutched in one gloved hand, and a ghoulish mask on his face, with glass over his eyes and a long trunk where his mouth should be. Such an individual, with such evident malice, could not enter our lives as a friend. His visage is an invite to war. Though the man has abided by our wishes to remain outside the town gates until this report is published, he has shown little respect for any of our other purities. He constantly coquettes with the girls that come to watch him by the gateposts, but ignores the boys that follow them; he has often thrown them scraps of paper with mysterious passages scrawled on them, strange food from outside the valley, and trinkets and baubles that he pulls from his pack. My own daughter will rarely come home before midnight, entranced by this exotic wight who claims to have crossed the dark sea. I propose that his presence will only provoke a dangerous ambition within our young, to our detriment; the outside world is a tempting lure for the stupid. How this man found his route here is a completely separate matter; when quizzed by myself earlier on in the week, he stated that he had come “writing in the saddle, pouring drink to us, ready to drink with us, to work demons with us.” Even if such an odd statement were true (which we have no way of verifying) the thought of a fugitive conjurer (or whatever his provenance must be) cataloguing our way of life is complete anathema to what this civil thane believes this town stands for. I have asked him for credentials, and he has only given me scraps of paper with strange symbols and ranked lines upon them, more spells and problems for a town with enough of its own. If these uncertainties and dangers were not enough to warrant this man's ejection from our community, I would like to draw the committee's attention to the Hidden Press, in its wisdom, and I know that I draw no friends with this tactic. Though the word of the Press is no longer writ by law, its teachings still hold some value for this humble servant, and will, hopefully, have some bearing on the committee's decision. I speak only for Whisper, and his eternal absence. His wisdom still moves me. Let it move you. I have consulted with the Mayor on this matter and he shares my fears. I respectfully request that the man be led to the edge of our domain, given fresh water and sent on his way. I propose no violence (unless made necessary by his actions), merely respect for tradition and the safety of our way of life. Your slave in all, sirs, Death In Strange Light (Here is found a strange sigil, depicting a frowning, bearded face) REJECTED By Order of the Town Committee and the Mayor. Stranger is to be allowed access to the town for half a year to study and observe the town's people. Discretion must be exercised. Stranger to be billeted in the dead lecturer's room at the expense of Building 4's commune tin for the duration of his stay; however, the rights of Ancient Lights and Wake Of The Room shall be null and void in his case, should they be requested. Food and spiritual sustenance to be provided by the Town Hall. The plans for a small welcome celebration, in order to showcase the hospitality of our valley, are being finalised, with funds coming from the Mayor's personal finances. (What follows is a diary entry written directly into the journal). February 9th I was in my tent carving stakes when I heard the trumpet; one can never be too careful, as Baden once told me. It had sounded as if it was right outside, though stepping into the open air I realised it came from far off, right across the valley in the crumpled lee of one of the mountains, ricocheting off my surroundings on the clearest morning in days. The gates were being opened. They were large and cast in iron inexpertly, bubbles and fissures erupting over the strange cuneiform that was carved into them. I was greeted by a cavalcade of what I assumed to be dignitaries; I eventually realised, in hallooing them, that they were merely well-wishers and the curious, ordinary folk; yet more rubes. I packed up my tent under their watchful eyes, enduring their questions about the eyeholes in the tent sheet and the Hellenist script stitched into the lining, and crossed with them into the town. I found myself on a long dirt road lined with small homes, leading towards the haze of what I assumed to be the city itself. Long brown pennants hung on flagpoles, like those that myself and the children hung to greet Lancelot in Lyonesse, though they were far smaller and hung limply like elderly coughs in the frigid stillness. The people were dirty and silent, then, as if they were smuggling me in, and I wondering briefly if this is what was happening. I began to fret that this was not the right town, that I had stumbled on some Hyperborean refuge sheltered from civilisation and proper breeding. There was no fanfare, no crowds; even the curiosity of the rubes had waned. In the bright sparkling horror of that morning I do remember seeing something remarkable; in a small copse to the side of the road, almost obscured by the trees, another of the great “Mother Kilns” could be seen, with the thrusting member, smoke pouring from her breast-holes. Behind her, like ducklings, were several smaller stoves, perhaps the size of kennels, into which people dressed in blue tunics stuffed some sort of fish, turning to watch me as I passed. I smelt halibut, but the specimen had been long-raked, red with a scissoring beak. Our group passed along the road until we reached greasy cobbles that looked like un-yeasted rolls. This rude civilisation seemed to put a glamour on my party, and they dashed in all directions, calling to me. I set off after them, stumbling past dwarf firs and beds of wild sage with my pack swinging, and rounded the corner of a watchtower into what appeared to be a very facile likeness of the Palatine Hill. A paved square of granite looked over by buildings of an almost Teutonic regularity. They were more like slabs of base stuff, not hollow at all, but rather solid blocks that pretended to be inhabited. I could see no obvious apertures on any of them. Around the square were huge, glass fishbowls set on lampposts, though they were empty of motion or colour. There was a middling crowd in the centre of the plaza, nothing like those that I greeted me at Lhasa or Machu or Mag Mell, but it seemed that I was wanted, after all. The crowd parted for me, and in its centre there stood a tiny Buddha of a man, a grinning wattle that I was to learn was named Star Watching At Sea, and who through some despotic, gangrenous process had become Mayor. After he had greeted me in a rather discourteous tone, he hurried and shooed his people aside to reveal tables laden with jellies, products of pork, and other hardy fare. Then there came music, dancing, more music, wreaths of herbs and garlic and strange lightning-shaped tassels thrown about me; I had seen it before, everywhere I have been. This pathetic god-posturing, the scraping of pride, the jizz-like pomade in every hairstyle. At least the kappas had eaten fruit; scurvy still haunts me at night with lecherous little prods. I was asked to speak, briefly, behind a lectern made of one old oak trunk, and was given a bare wire that ran through the crowd like a forest trail into the bare flank of one of the buildings. Luckily, my week-long solitude had given in to writing, and I read my poem with great solemnity, though their primitive personal address system shocked my teeth and rattled the thin walls of the speaker-house so badly that I felt that my bowel would pop. I shook the hands of many women and girls, including the thin one to whom I had given the leopard seal jerky after she had climbed the gatepost and let her legs out to the sun, singing. She was held on the shoulder by her father. I touched a great, golden key, held out to me in utter silence, and the town broke into applause. I do not know what it is for. An orchestra seemed to materialise out of nowhere, thirty of them or so, the crowd filled with waistcoats and ruffs, cravats fluffed and primmed like inflated mating sacs on Asian birds. After they had greeted me they waved bashfully to their stern wives, half of them lamed by milk leg. They were all quite drunk, and sheltered a menagerie of instruments both strange and familiar; the mandolin sat next to harps twenty feet tall, plucked with long hooks, and men who stroked their hands as if comforting the most fragile songbird, rubbing them against the elderly, marbled fat striated through their cheeks.. I asked them several times if I could record one of their songs and take some photographs, and after some confusion I produced my Lavalier box and my camera. As they crowded at the invisible line they had drawn between themselves and the technology, the thin girl’s father wandered over, and gruffly stated his name as Death in Strange Light. He implied quite plainly, almost immediately, that I was considered beneath him, and should name him Mr. Light when in public. His daughter followed him at heel, and stated that her name was Death of a Friend, before her father silenced her with a finger. He asked me what the devices were, and I explained, trying to stay clear of religious imagery or witch-speak. Finally, he agreed that I could record one song and take six photographs, and so I chose wisely as I was steadily introduced to the town’s inhabitants. Death of a Friend spent much of her time close by, when her father was not watching, and quietly told me that I was to lodge in the same building as her, a few floors below, where a man had died the previous year. She is plainer up close, but still pretty, and I like that she washes her hair to the point of needing a comb-over; cleanliness seems an idiosyncrasy in this community of beet-wind and long, mournful belches. The valley is, I will admit, very beautiful; it has no obvious magic, or ruin of grandeur, but the town nestles into its lee appropriately, and in a funny way it reminds me of Asphodel; clean, bright, where souls chase each other through quiet streets. I asked the Mayor if there existed a map of the town that I might study; he told me that he would fetch me the one in his personal collection from which to take notes. I can feel the heat of Mr. Light's glare upon me constantly, as if he expects me to stab his friends before him, or explode into shards of metal. The ruddy, dim-witted children kept tugging at my mask; I had to bat them away with as much force as I dared. After the celebrations the whole town trailed behind me as I was led on a tour. I swiftly grew tired; the air here is close and humid, hemmed in by the contours around us, and my legs were stiff after my week-long meditation. The well-wishers began to disappear home to dreams of electricity and the wall, and soon a compact bolus of entourage, including the sweating Mr. Lights and his daughter, was making its way through conifer groves to the tree-line. The path here was sculpted into the rock in scalloped steps; how odd that it should smell so like a sewer up in the clean air! We began to pass eyelets in the rock, tiny, drilled holes that were widened by the rain’s fingering, and the smell grew a source; I attempted to look within them, but some poured creamed, rancid smoke in pillars, and from others the smell of excrement was so strong that I nearly fell to my death on more than one occasion. The mayor, tied to the man behind by means of a thick rope, swallowed his catarrh and said plainly that we were passing their least holy shrines. I did not know what to say to this, and instead looked out, down again to the dark, evergreen groves. In amongst them, in the dying light, I could see deep holes in the knots of root at their base, wide warrens around which was splashed colourful paint as if by children, and more of those odd little lightning strips, tied down against an illusory wind. I pointed to them, but the mayor merely shook his head, and ushered me on. The mountains are unbroken and high around the whole valley, and disappear into the blue screen of distance. There is one mountain that seems sculpted from iron filings, it is so whipped and uninviting. It towers over everything else, and I see it is too high for even water vapour or ice to settle on its climes. The Mayor calls it the “north” Mountain, though perhaps this is a nickname, as it seems to lie to the east of the town by the sunset’s reckoning. We eventually came to a little caldera, and those behind the mayor gratefully shut their eyes for a few minutes and spoke of dinner and work as I surveyed all that I could see. I will try to commit as much to a drawn map as possible, for it is much larger than I thought at first. The town is laid out in both irregular and regular angles, with some streets wide and Roman, while others evoke a old Balkan city, with redoubts, doublings back, the twist of alleys and gardens; all of the roofs are coloured teal, or cerulean, or other colours that resemble the human eye from space. There is a vast forest, broken with minuscule clearings, over to the west, and at that time it was lit in such a way as to be unspeakable. Though the distance made it hard to judge, it may be even larger than the town itself. I remember now, some days later, the smell, over everything. There was a mix of smoke in the air; from wood, from meat, from peat and rock, they rubbed together like fuel at altitude. We took so many paths I cannot remember how we returned; I had seen the hint of a burial-place, ritual or common, and we trod the board-walk of new wood by the river; how I marvelled at the icebergs, some as large as cottages, wedged resolutely in the stream itself! The ambient heat made such saurians, such elemental things, seem impossible and the stuff of dreams. I was shown the gates of the town zoo, locked up and quite pathetic, and the slender, cosmopolitan profile of the First Loss (a hotel of some luxury where, oddly, I am not staying), and finally to my lodgings. The building is tall and wooden, surrounded by identical brothers in a pattern like buttons on a typewriter; canals diverted from the river flow between them, crossed by tiny, humped bridges. I write this on my bunk; the walls are Spartan, and alien with a waxy fish oil used as varnish. I have posted my effects around me, but not even Bismark’s Tooth REF//::12018476393923 Folders 9J-10P: “Effects, Burnt, Drowned, Misc.” can lift this strangeness, and such is its only real use. I feel something that I have not felt in a long while. There is a great warmth that surrounds the building even at night, and a gushing of drains or the river; oddly, it seems to come from above me. The Mayor and his council bid me goodnight at the door, and Death of a Friend and her father led me to my room. Indeed, they live a few floors above me, though there is a staircase that winds all the way up to my floor, around the outside of the building, like scaffolding on an abbey. Reminder – I must try and see inside this silent, foreboding hotel; perhaps renovations are being undertaken, and as such I am billeted here amongst locals. However, my impression is that the town does not receive enough visitors for such a building to make enough gold or gems or paper or stone or whatever they use to barter here; it’s as splendid as the Stanley before that little goblin Bachman ruined everything. I hope that they can exchange my molars; I have held onto them too long. But what use has a secret such as this place for currency?</Text>
            <Notes>Oannes knows how such a report as this was rejected, but I was allowed into the town against the best wishes of Mr. Light. It all seemed to sprout from my attraction to his daughter he cannot deny that she is a beauty, at least by the local troglodytic standards. A waifish neck, long hair cleaner than most, stunning skin beneath her eyes, no tiredness. And moody too, much like her father, but with a pout that I cannot resist. Even I make mistakes; I will not use the name for long. A true joke; he is a gravedigger, one who constantly smells of earth and the onions of that earth. However, I have seen some of the people here wearing small caskets on their foreheads and strapped to the wrists like watches. Merely my measurements. So grandiose! A man who loves words like a wall, or a umbrella to keep out rain. I loathe him more and more. As I was soon to find out, this consultation was of a rather thorough variety; Mr. Lights is the lover of the Mayor, and seems to bend his ear in whatever way he can. There is a rather Greek brashness about their love; hungry kisses between two ugly men in public are never attractive. Not up to scratch, it seems. Everywhere this proliferation of English! And completely unaccented, with little hoarseness so often found in alpine folk; when I speak of accents, it has not the dull whitter of a London English, but a true lack of intonation and vowel excitement beyond the very basic sounds themselves. An isolate dullness. They try to repeat my own accent like mixing spring water in an oil-spill, and I must be careful not to generate a creole. Their ethnicity, at first glance and without phrenology seems mainly Nordic Caucasian, though the wide brows and flat nasals bring to mind Linnaeus Asiaticus or the burly Mongoloid. The women are pappish and long-nippled, though shy to the point of aggression, whereas the men seem complacent, lazy, and sneering in the manner of the Afer. I have seen these since, often hidden in a grove of trees or behind a flint wall leading to farmland. Their purpose cannot be for the cooking of food, as one can see fishbones within, mingling alongside streaked cushions of ash. They leave the meat to dissolve and char. I have noticed, however, that they are never placed in front of a Mother Kiln, but trail behind, cast like fat children. To this day I only know that the library and the town hall were truly habitable; the others I never saw entered, though occasionally men in smocks would open hatches in their side to remove hammers, or cloth, or long poles. Why does the love of the Mayor live apart from him?</Notes>

            <Title>A Note On Lodgings</Title>
            <Text>The only place more cramped and inhospitable that I have retired was in Marwencol, though I cannot blame the men and women of that place for their disabilities. I have sealed the door with my cloak, but I worry about the window; I have not slept with my gas mask on since Tintagel, and I do not relish the memory; the rasping struggle in every snore, the slow clouding in my eyelets, as if death was coming in my own breath. However, I suppose that the size does not matter, really; outside of my quarters the building is some sort of miniature Babylon! Each floor holds different treasures; the buzzing I hear must be machinery or great pumps, as the river is somehow lifted from the canals below and runs along several floors above mine; people can while away afternoons on its banks, six storeys up! There are gardens full of produce that run alongside it with only a few windows bringing in the strong sun, and Friend has told me that the cellar is full of mushrooms sprouting on cut logs. One of the floors spirals inwards like a maze, before reaching a door that is locked to me. Above is something of a communal chamber; the samovar in the centre burns star-hot and blackens my ceiling in a tight ring. There is another lock on the hatch that leads up to the roof, though something is mooing or cawing up there; a basilisk, or merely chickens? At the moment no one will tell me; they just stir their soup in silence, whiling away the long evenings with thoughts and strange games which I can have no part in. They rarely speak to one another. There is a medieval darkness at night; I can only see the lights on the river, those of the dark fishermen. I saw their long poles ending in knives, though they seem not to use them; they leave their washing over them, and plunge their hands into the fast stream to bring up their catch. On my bed, when I arrived, was a large pile of coins, completely blank and around the size of an old penny. I seem to be able to exchange them for goods, but no-one will take any of my old currency in like. I wonder if they understand economics as I do. I was given a souvenir at the Inauguration by a rather senior gentleman purple with bath-brew; it is a youthful looking moon, cast in heavy metal on a red cord, with a wonderful scalloped surface that is calming to stroke. In fact, I feel a need to do so now; my feet are bleeding and I still cannot remove my wraps. Maybe tomorrow.</Text>
            <Notes>Apparently the obsession with height rather than width in the architecture of the town is to do with a concept known as Ancient Lights; I have heard it mentioned many times but have as yet to uncover its significance. I will attempt to find some literature on the subject and compose an essay when I find the time.</Notes>

            <Text>I am a small man. I am five feet four inches in height, “the proper length of an oorang”, as Brutus loved to remind me. I have acne on my shoulders that irezumi has failed to swallow up, back ache, gallstones, a septic thumb from playing with my reflexes at Tom Wat; it is still swollen, and that girl still rises, black almost to a shade of green in my skull, where I left her weeping, my thumb weeping. The littoral of my hair is gone floating with the rub and heft of the rubber that I must wear, and my backside sweats if I sit too long. But these men and women are not my betters; they are almost Neanderthal. The tallest of them do not even reach me, and their chests are quite pigeoned; perhaps this is why only a few of them will scale the mountains. In my first days emerging from my dwelling they milled around me like buoys against a sandbar, confused and confusing in the clothing they wear. Their names are long, heavy constructions, and each seemingly a story; I met Young Bird Snared By Badger, his younger, petulant brother Badger And Emphysema, the dancer Uncle Felled By Gorse and her babe Cycle Crash By Moonlight; and yet they are so unwelcoming when I ask of their etymology! They tell me that their names make them angry, or happy, and will offer no more. Why on earth would someone choose a name that brings them only irritation? They will not tell me. Maybe others will. I have time enough for that. Coming downstairs on my second day I met two serious young men racing out of the main door to the apartment block. One was slighter, paler than the other, and his soul seemed to know that it was sickly; he is not seen to smile. The other is heavier set, and tanned; he obviously spends more time outdoors. Maybe the first one is a writer, I remember thinking. As I engaged them with a rap of my book against the wall they scratched to a stop, shuffled nervously, and introduced themselves as Discovering Leprosy and Love For All Gods, and I realised that I had taken photographs of them on my first day here; I met so many people I had quite forgotten about them. They said that they were sportsmen, though Discovering Leprosy gave Love For All Gods a sharp look when he said this. Death of a Friend follows me, every time I leave the building; I never see her door open, and I am wary, for Mr. Lights, her father, most definitely hates me; no one else has fallen under his spell, but I hear him shouting about me from his room, and the few times we have crossed paths in the last few days he has flashed me a look the likes of which I haven't seen since Alexandria and that delightful little kelpie. I have no wish for a shotgun wedding in this place, no matter how beautiful it is; the harpoon has left its traces in my thigh before. But when I am crossing Main Street, with gibbering children following me, trying to gift me souvenirs and their parent's prized chattels in exchange for pieces of my costume, she peeks around the doors and windows of the mullioned tea rooms, or tries not to splutter as she leers from the shop that pours acrid smoke constantly, and wishes me good day. Our paths seem to cross an awful lot. Today, though, she came to my door, and offered to show me more of the town. I had yet to explore much deeper than the main thoroughfare and the channels and bridges surrounding the water and my apartment. I agreed; her dress was short and I was sick of what I had seen. The back of her legs were like a piebald velour, that shimmered when the muscles moved. We walked through the tributaries and the high arching bridges in blocked granite, where those long lightning strips trail into the water. As I peered over the railings I saw the terrified ripples of living things, a shimmer of chitin amongst ghostly arenas of frond and paddle, and I asked what they were. She giggled, peering over with me, before sending an arcing spittle past me and answering, “fairies!” I must ask her about her heritage, and watch her brow for any Cro-Magnon abutment. With her father fucking the Mayor, who knows what forks in the road her ancestors took. There were signs on every corner, tall and yellow against the dark windows, that forbade the dumping of corpses or urine into the stream; the black outline of a prostrate man was on fire, black grains of himself falling into the stencilled waves below. The apartment district, the smallest sliver of the great terraces of Ry'leh, an organising hand sweeping away the tracery of dead gods, opens out into a wide plaza where the official buildings are found. The scaffolding constructed for my welcome, thrown up in under two hours by teams of bored youths, was still standing. I was due at the Town Hall the following day to see the Mayor's collection of maps; it is a tall, utilitarian structure, with no obvious doors or windows, no entrants or exeunts, like all of the buildings around the square. I can imagine Ioseb as I knew him, with a patterned tribal scarf around his neck, wearing the suit of a savant, his beard full of pork jelly, walking in the pure strident noiselessness between these places, touching the stone with hand suited for moleculars, and smiling at how smooth is was, how perfect, how unmarred by chisel or transport. I had no idea how they were constructed, or how men or women entered them for business; perhaps the Mayor wished to test me. I strode slightly ahead of Death of a Friend to take a photograph of the entire plaza. Without warning, however, she ran at me, crowing and baying and calling for me to stop. I did so, ruffled by her intrusion, and she pointed to a Venn Diagram inlaid in gold and red bone in the cobbles. She pointed out that this was the Execution Venn, whatever such a thing means; she explained that anyone stepping inside the rings, guilty or not, would be executed by the Town Council. Such a thing seemed laughable to me, and I hovered my foot over the ring, as she pulled me back from the border. The cobbles seemed so clean! I felt that she must have lied to me, to impress me. We passed an edifice that could only be religious, great suppurating mounds vomiting rainwater from the night before into the waiting mouths of not-gargoyles, not even grotesques. It was as if someone had draped a dead, heavy-breasted colossus over the structure, fusing its mammaries with the stone, the memories of its tubes flowing with calcite and limescale. She looked at it, suppressed a belch and clicked her fingers at it, once, twice, a third time behind her back. I looked at her, and she frowned and motioned for me to do the same, though I would not belch in my mask, as only I would suffer. We headed from the square into small streets that run in all directions, high walls and hedges holding chapels or museums that no-one visits, or the lowing of great mysterious beasts. People dodged to and fro between ancient buildings, some of them wattle and daub, some timbered, some made of pristine metal. There were shops and cafés; I felt like I was in Europe again. We stopped to drink what I thought was coffee, but was more like a sour, black syrup; she asked me which books I had read, and I tried to list them, starting from the beginning. I think that she was pretending to know the titles that I recounted, as every so often her head would bounce and she would grin and sigh into the near distance, as if remembering a certain plot-twist that we could both share. It grew dark as we set off back to the square. Someone had lit the street-lights, and I saw then what these huge bulbs were for. Death of a Friend called them “the universe”, as if she had some concept of 'universe' that I was unaware of, though I had to admit that the lights within could be imagined as some primordial borscht – they spread out like bright acid, in long lines, pulsing and casting an eerie glow over the whole space. I think of Tesla. He would be more suited to such a trip. We mounted the steps to a vast rotunda, again portal-less, decorated with statues of vast men and beasts, all of them being tortured by vile devices or projections. Both Friend and I searched for any crevice or depression that might give a way an opening, before there was a sharp click, and a small man, so frail he seemed to be a man of motes, a man of dust, appeared in a slobber of light. His voice did not waver, as he began to scream vile murder. Friend stepped forward, obsequious and quivering. The man stopped his commotion, smiled, and apologised to Friend. He beckoned us inside. The girl had revived the old bugger, and he introduced himself as Spider's Nest in Barn. There was a touch of the double Humberts about him, busy fingers, woollen vest, filthy, crenellated ears, veins that ran through the stout bulkhead of nose and pipe. He finally recognised my presence, and asked me, by way of greeting, when I had last had sex. I started at his impertinence, before remarking that it had been three months, and he wove a little sign on the air, danced a small jig of happiness, and remarked that he was still a virgin, before lambasting foreigners in all their guises. I did not know whether to console him or celebrate. He breathed deeply and showed me into the library that he curated. He noticed the velour, also. It was small. I had imagined phalanxes of scrolls bound in alligator teeth, or letters suspended in viscous jelly, or lights that played across steel screens, or tablets and statues that would give me something to read; something spectacular. But there were three shelves of books, one of them a collection of pulp adventure stories, yellowing and thumbed heavily by oily pads, I balked at this expression of otherness that seemed to precede me, seeing one pressed open on a small table beside a rickety ladder ascending to a loft. A phrase jumped at me from the page, and I thought that I had imagined it circled, but it could not have been; the cloak hid him from the heathen eyes, and the darkness brought him.I asked the little chap, politely, if there were any more books. He snorted, and asked the need. I was inclined to agree with him, and worried; was Loss not what I had read of? Was it this scruffy, muddy town, with none of Rome's glory, or Ethiop's palaces, or Glastonbury's trilling masses and bleating sacrifice? Was it merely the last suction of these inbred limpets before the disappeared into the deep of the mountains, the oceans I had crossed? I resolved to spend much of my time reading, and proving myself wrong. I had not travelled as far as I had to be disappointed and to leave without answers. Perhaps Friend can be persuaded to tell me more. I also cannot keep writing her name out in full; it is too long. She is just Friend, now. An Essay On Ancient Lights Any building in the town limits may rise as high as is feasible and physical, but may not spread more in width than five times the arm-span of its lawful owner. There is a certain quaint concept of “vacuum light”, received from space and unsullied by air, that each person has a birthright to strive for. Each building conducts its own, private Babel, basking in venerable rays that lance towards Earth from their ancestral home – that is, anywhere but here. MacArthur was right; I have finally met my little green men! See further notes on the “Hidden Press”. The ancient lights princiuple needs to be changed. They would not want to be seen from space. “Create a cone of time”</Text>
            <Notes>I had been led to believe it was January when I arrived here; there was ice on the sea, and the sailors wore greased jackets. But now they tell me it is the height of summer, and the weather is certainly of that season. They say that it is maybe June, or August, but they do not know. I will continue to use my own calendar, to preserve morale, but I do not think that I have passed far enough from Greenwich. I see no clocks, or watches.</Notes>

            <Title>Considerations - Characters</Title>
            <Text>CHARACTERS

The townspeople, whilst not stupid, are generationally naive - there is an obvious disconnect between what they believe happens and what actually happens in their town. There are degrees to which this is obvious to the readers, and at other times the truth is almost unattainable.

The Witch Doctor

- At the moment, she is too much like a Christ figure. I think that she does need to die, but not as a vessel for everybody else’s hatred. 
- Are these beasts her children?
- Saman - shaman - “correct, excited, moved, raised”.
- The shaman comes face-to-face with the spirits. They benefit the society as a whole, as opposed to a magician. Relationship is one of control: I suppose, then that she is not a shaman at all. A shaman needs a community to protect and serve. 
- Shamanism is a complex, the role of an actor and ecstatic intermediary. “The Wounded Healer”, as Joan Halifax said. 
- She is the only one who bathes, and is therefore sexualised. 
- A juxtaposition of fear and trust.
- Hexen Meester.
- Music is linked to trance. 
- The witch is a construction of his mind. 
- Is she a monster? Does she get involved in childbirth?

Death Of A Friend

- She is very talkative.
- Her hair hangs in her eyes like the skin in a medical diagram.
- She becomes a figurehed and a psychopomp for talking to him. 
- She wants to bathe for him, but cannot. 

Mr. Lights

- If he is really Death Of A Friend’s lover, why is he attracted to the Mayor? What has caused this to arise? He likes the man as a friend</Text>

            <Title>Small Framed Photograph </Title>
            <Text>A small painting in a cheap frame. Description The painting, perhaps produced by a simpleton or child, depicts a beach scene, a cobbled road leading through an arch, and flowered meadows, to a wide sea. The foreground is in shadow, as if something is behind the painter. Attached to it by string is a luggage label, which when clicked reads: Sir And Magus, My spawn sends her regards and apologises for the incident yesterday. She will be beaten, as per your request. Please accept this gift from both of us. Safe Travels, Death In Strange Light March 16th If the reader clicks the four metal clasps on the back the frame comes apart, and they will find a scrap of fabric, stitched with mountain flowers: it is the same material that Death of a Friend is wearing in photographs of her. In spilled ink, with a pained hand, is a small devotive message: I forgive you. I am your pet. Sometimes we must kick a dog.</Text>

            <Title>Entry 4 - The Bestiary</Title>
            <Text>(This section is pasted into the journal, and is printed on very old paper, almost silky in consistency). The Apologist's FRANK Falsehood Doubting://9283267B Has the Eremite the stomach? A personal aside, both these men are liars with a penchant for flamboyance. Has the Eremite ever seen these things? They are barely mentioned elsewhere, and seem an afterthought in the tradition of the worst falsifiers. BESTIARY Being A Diverse Menagerie Of The Singular Valley Of Loss Compiled In The Year That Hatred Found The Mayor, Young Love In Spring, And He Ordered The K!K!K! Field Razed To The Ground, And Was Executed For His Crimes Commissioned By Loss Town Hall, The Time That Muscles Popping Lifting Grain Cut Off His Wife's Hand With A Scythe, And Because Of Her Ugliness Threw Her Into The Pageant Weevil's Nest At The Point Where The River Splits And The Glacier Melted, Consigning Her To Death And His Children To Ignominy Printed By Grace Of Funds The Time The Strawberry Seeds Came By Stranger's Pack The Amoeba On The Windowsill: The Scatterbird For low to the ground, the scatterbird is seen. He is a fulsome crow-shape, black with black talons, a wrinkled inky beak. He feasts on the insects and diverse fruits of the field; he is wise as we are, though, and will not touch the circling beetle, the retarded poisoner. He lives in the field, in long grass, or wheat, or beet plants; he luxuriates in the cover of night and vegetation, and is rarely seen on the ground. Though crow-like, he is large, like a dog, and waddles painfully and gainlessly over small obstacles as if they were eyries capped in ice. A rather ugly, shoddy gentleman; more like a rutting hog than a bird of the air. But, such a transformation! Such a sea change, when threatened, or approached! A farmer will enter his field; a flat plain of swaying, whispering crop, a slingshot in one hand, a whistle in the other. He casts the stone far into the scrying pool of his property; the scatterbird is his foe on the ground, for he churns the fields to mud and breaks the stalks of his harvest. The stone clatters to the shrub, and the whistle blows; four or five scatterbirds lurch into the air, lethargic and duggish, no more than three hands above the wheat, and there they split. Those dark shapes, atavistic as soot against rock, divide as myriad forms; the large, rolling drudge explodes into twenty, thirty flitting things the size of sparrows, and where there were five, now there are hundreds, and the farmer's field is blotted out by these living colonies. Each fat crow-thing is a monastery built of the bodies of scores of sparrow-things, living together, feeding together, but jostled apart, cowardly and ultimately alone, to slink back under the cover of night and fuse once more. The Crippled Scapegoat: The Pageant Weevil For everywhere is the Pageant Weevil to be found, and obvious by its colour and its gait; it is bright and primary, each patterned different from its kin. It is positively mathematical in its disability, slowly walking in regular ellipses to transport itself across the ground. One would be tempted to think this a cruel play of nature, though Man, in all his wisdom, is the architect of this creature's injuries, for its sin and for his own. They can be seen hermetic and in solitude, away from heat and population; they have a shared, almost religious terror of humanity. One must be sure to look past the ridiculous heraldry and the pitiful condition of such creatures and see the true venom within. For there is a sinner's poison, a malicious seeking of heat and light that draws these beetles to the feet of revellers, farmers, children and hunters, sinking their long mandibles into the soft flesh; exacting a sort of mortifying, necrotic revenge. For these creatures are tarred ludicrous by man, and catalogued by him; parties of townsfolk, elected by the town hall, head into the fields and woods with nets, scissors and paintbrushes; children are sometimes brought along, sheepish and feverish with fear, to teach them of the Weevil and its dangers. The insects are discovered in long brush or the bark of trees, in colonies of four or five, and are fastened in place with netting and long callipers. Held thus or with careful hands wrapped in muslin they are painted and varnished in vaudeville lines, and their front left leg sliced off. They must then be let free; one must be very careful not to kill such humble things, as even a single weevil destroyed results in mysterious proliferation in all parts of the valley, with more poisonings and more work. However, few are now found with a bare shell and a full set of legs, and most of the nests are marked obvious with Long Man Strips and bright paint. No cure has been found for their poison, and this battle will continue this way; the patrols that document these slight enemies bring a gross communal ecstasy, and we must be vigilant to protect our children from the horror of that first spark of poison and painful death. We shall lose few more, by Whisper. Lo, Bright, Stupid Master: The Turkey Dragon One need only to gaze up at the herald of our clandestine urbanity, garlanded by fluttering Long Tails, the lacquered shields and sentinels that gaze droopy-lidded over our leaders and committees and songs, to see the great and awful Turkey Dragon, our carnation and our greatest shame. She no longer exists in her natural state; the only specimens still breathing are the inbred dynasties cooped in this urban pavilion. She is a heavy, drooping slug, reptilian and feathered, a cockatrice whose stare only invites hilarity and ridicule. She has four legs, though they all are withered as grapes becoming raisins and are taloned roughshod and unkempt, with wide, greasy hairs diversely spread. She blunts her claws on rocks as she stumbles onward, and sprouts membranous canopies, though canopy is too illustrious a term; they are shrubs of wings. Her heavy beak is filled with teeth, irregular and crooked, shattering and cracking the keratin as she grinds the rotten meat and vegetation she is fed; she produces the most godly stink. Great porcine tusks nudge their way from her mouth, narrowing her gut and reducing her breathing to a mousey groan. She is, by all true standards, a waste of life. And yet we see her as beautiful, and hated by the gods, and so she is ours, our sacred, our prow. Fewer and fewer have been born in recent years; witnessing the violence and unhygiene of her mating habits, it is no surprise. She is the last of the valley gigantics, and the most tragic. We give her an annual stipend of cutlery and billy cans from the Kettle Guard's barracks so that she can form her own hordes whilst in captivity, though they are small and pitiful compared with the treasures from our greatest dirges; zeniths of stolen metal, secreted under the mountains and in great nests built of mucus that cap the highest peaks. They are our greatest songs by their fleetness; for we may not know them long. They may shuffle back into the caves and hollows of our heads, scraping sparks on the walls with their wide, turgid skulls and clumsy sharpness, the last, spastic light before they slump into the dark. The Compass And The Coral: The Cartographile Upon following the channel of the serpentine river that cuts its way through our great valley, wending as it will through homes, taking solace in the fields, burrowing into the maze of the pitch, the chill of the water, the tumbling ice and rock that forces spume and foam through channels no wider than a child's breadth, it seems impossible that anything could survive in the tempest that runs out to no sea, much less anchor itself in place; however, below the surface of the river, like a millipede scaled, the cartographiles have given us the names of paths, the nature of hidden places and the temples that we may build. One has never been seen in its entirety, being some miles long, it hugs the bank almost from source to delta, knocking against its sleeping companions. Their long mouths hold nets of needle teeth, that filter and crush debris that tumbles down from the mountain and the town. They possess thousands of tiny legs, more like hooks and stunted as if in a bumping womb, that vice to the bank with the temerity of a saint. They regard the maelstrom above as sanctuary, and though their backs are armoured and serrated, they turn their plump, pustulate bellies up to the sun. This trust, and lethargy, grants them their greatest virtue. Their stomachs are long ranks of acne, stretch marks and scars that can only be the product of the boulders, branches and bodies that dance down on the top-stream. Yet, apart from the gods and their reason, and by the power of man and stupidity, these lesions are the maps of our surroundings; a precise cartography in rude nature! They show the tracks that loggers use to reach their shrines and kilns, the floor plan of the Town Hall, each yearly construction added in the some chaotic line of sharp flint tumbling down from its perch to score open flesh. Some say that one particularly senior creature holds the plan of the K!K!K! Pitch, though the Town Hall has denounced every rumour-smith identified as murderers, thieves and foreigners and hung all until dead swiftly. If one can brave the tumult, and the carnivores and jitter-weeds that frond and billow just below the surface of the stream, one can feel out the road to one's own home, or that of a neighbour, or perhaps the secret paths that lead out of the valley; appeals have been made to remove and skin one of the cartographiles for better study of its dermography, but talks are slow, and the beasts slumber, oblivious in their pubescent cataloguing of our world.</Text>
            <Notes>A rather poor choice for the Bestiary; an apparently sickly individual, a virtual recluse and celibate how did he ever have the stomach to record these creatures? I seem to have transgressed some sort of Wallace Line, as soon as I saw that dribbling woodcutter emerge from the trees. A rather quaint method of chronological datum; its verbosity speaks to me. A message of morality rather than zoology? I recorded a folktale relating to such a beast, told to me in the tavern off Main Street by Great Oar and Headwound, the scabrous landlord and my fancier, I reckon. I tried to acquire a flag, though my sketch will have to do; stealing a flag is punishable by death, and the few I could find are too high, or locked away behind glass. The town zoological institute is small and badly kept, though it must be an ancient place, if it was present in the time of the Apologist. The railings are overgrown with creeper and red ivy, and the roofs of the houses poke through the foliage like rune-stones or the hats of sleeping picnickers. There is a Dragon House marked on a venerable signpost just beyond the fence, though I have been told by everyone that I have asked that it is locked and I am expressly forbidden from entering. There is certainly the smell of fresh defecate, perhaps turned by forks. Reminder: must ask Spider about the zoo. The entrance remains locked, and no one even looks at it as they pass, and yet I alone can hear scratchings from behind the gate, echoing as if from a drain. They are keeping something or someone in there. I think of Omelas in such times, and imagine leaving this place as I did then, wreathed in fire and looking to the desert... It seems that such creatures are venerated for their sheer uselessness; no God could love such a thing, and so the deipathic townsfolk treat them much as the Hindu sadhus do their cattle, or the Shinto their crows and foxes.</Notes>

            <Title>Meta Introduction</Title>
            <Text>META CONCERNS

Features

Length - 200 storylets, around 30-50 pieces of Miasma Content

Community
- The community will centre around the Institute’s prime mechanic of Push Storytelling - bringing the story in a modular way to people through their chosen avenues. The community expands this out onto the web in a non-proprietary way, giving them a chance to push things to each other, as well. It creates a web instead of a pyramid ramp. 
- Media is a way to mediate human relations, anthropologically, and this is both the subject and goal of this experience.

Experience Rather Than Text
- The text is the medium, rather than the sale. The experience is wrapped in the interface, story, audio, 3D models, user tactility, community, discussion, and every aspect of what could be called Black Crown. They are important to the enjoyment, and to say “if you choose to pay, you are only paying to get text more quickly” is very short-sighted. Signing up, also, needs to be very simple. 

Dynamic Machine Reaction To Players
- A game, an experience, cannot be static. It needs to react on every surface to player change and interaction. This is where the meta concerns of the project come into their own. The game, and we can react to how players are using to integrate the community into the craft of the thing.

Slow Games
- Slow games exist as part of life, with returnings to them, and the building of understanding, in a quotidian routine that allows contemplation instead of quickly-forgotten bursts of colour.
- I think a good quote to use is “slow purposeful accumulation of experiences”
- They should want to power through the content, but by imposing limits, we control the contemplation of the content, and it actually becomes an asset to be impatient, as it causes you to go and learn around the subject whilst you wait. 

Moderation
- This is an important part of maintaining an online community.
- As usual, people will banned if there is any real-world hatred.  

Learning
- The desire to learn is an important part of Black Crown. There will concepts and items that people may never have heard of, and at the end of the game, they will not have any mechanical improvement, but instead an improvement of the mind. I wish to encourage people to seek out links to learn more about the things that inspired the project. Things such as the Khan Institute, TED, Wikipedia, iTunes U, and other services, can embed nicely or lead people to further their knowledge on certain subjects. 

Not Integral For Enjoyment
- Though I believe the meta concerns of this project are extremely important, there will be plenty of people who do not have the time, or know-how, for interacting with them. People who are au fait with ARGs and other transmedia projects will lap it up. If we can encourage others to join in with this new way of interacting with books, that will be excellent, but we cannot make wider participation necessary for enjoyment. Some people may just wish to view the efforts of others, and we should make this easy to do, and others may only want to interact with story. However, we must remember that the whole point of this project is to disperse narrative, to make it ergodic, and non-trivial. There needs to be a willingness for effort on the part of every reader, though, even if the intensity of that effort may vary from person to person.

The Nature Of Canon
- Meta concerns naturally weaken the barriers of canon. Player contributions are important to this project, but giving them control is dangerous, as they can alter the experience for others in negative ways. The amount of canon democracy we allow is dependent on the story and how much we want the players to determine the culture of the Institute outside their department. Fan fiction is encouraged, but visibility to others in an official sense needs to be considered.

The Player Experience
- Players like to shut off some personalities and inhabit others for a while. Roleplaying is important to many people. The meta concerns give them a chance to open up their singleplayer roleplaying (which, despite some opinion, is important for escape, self-identification, and mental health) and present their personas to others in a way that they cannot hurt each other’s fictions, but only interact positively. The Institute employs people who enjoy this absurdity - playing up to these grand titles, empowering them in their weakness. Players become part of an “ultracult”, a way to show uniqueness in an age of corporate identity and rising population. 
- Players will form niches, task forces, groups and alliances. They are not random, and should be encouraged. The differences between them become inherent and self-reinforcing. Their default position is one of defence, and so forming groups should come naturally to them. The drive is forward, with complication, as some players will set themselves against others. The department fights its decay from within to survive and complete this change that they are instigating.

Case Studies

Jam With Chrome
A HTML5 (I assume?) experiment by Google, where people can play digital musical instruments, in their browser, using their mouse and keys. They can switch between instruments on the fly, and invite friends in to join them. This social experiment shows that sharing high-tech, accessible games is much easier on the web nowadays, and can be implemented in a way that makes it easy for people to share what they do with these tools with their friends. 

Myst Journals
Low-tech paper journals kept by players of the PC puzzle game Myst. These were often shared physically with local friends, as well as on the web when image-uploading became less of a headache. Fez, the recent Xbox 360 puzzle game, had a renaissance of people creating Tumblogs of these journals in which players attempted to work out the codes hidden in the game. What this shows is the drive of many players to use their own tools, outside of the game, to solve the more pressing, deep puzzles. Obviously, this does not apply to everyone who plays the game, or even the majority, but it reminds one of the adage to never treat your audience like idiots. They do not need to be handheld through the experience, in case one small obstacle causes them to leave. This is the “Anti-Smaug”, or “Attention Deficit” of which people are terrified on the Web at the moment.

Experiments

- Relating to the ‘Myst Journals’ above, there may be a way that we can embed this annotation, collation and analysis into the community itself. Profiles could be used on the Black Crown wiki to share their findings and become celebrities of exposition, solving puzzles first. 

- The Wiki, or community in general, is something that we need to initially create, but then allow to grow. We cannot influence it, I think, unless for storied reasons; for example, I think that the Institute could attempt to shut it down, in a Denial-Of-Service attack, and its denizens must defend it. Obviously, close analysis will yield interesting data, and allow the preparation of appropriate material much easier.  I think that you must have an account if you wish to join discussion and edit articles. I would also like to keep the real world out as much as possible, in terms of branding - this is a common anchoring technique in ARGs, but I think it will cheapen this. The Wiki is the safe haven for the players against the Institute, and the other departments; seeing as they are the ones driving the change, this is appropriate. 

- I like the idea of “connected blogs”; blogs that are either in-character or not, that feature players collating ideas and growing the world of the Institute. If we can link to these in-game, or in the Wiki, they can form part of the world itself. 

- Artwork related to the Institute should be promoted and sought, as well, as it is expensive to produce first-hand.

- I think that, in the future, there is room for producing physical editions of the works, including what players have been through in which order, and ordering them in a beautiful physical copy. We are nowhere near this yet, but it would be fun to see. 

- Giving players a random chance for a huge promotion, a vision, or some other event, incentivises play and increases mystery. That player becomes a psycho-pomp to the others, relaying what he has seen. 

- Annotation on the Miasma is something that we should experiment with. It should only be allowed to logged-in players, and the choice to view the annotations is by default negative. If you choose to, however, you can see discussions about the piece, with links to further analysis in the wiki. 

- A developer blog with meta-commentary, linked from the office content, but unrelated, allowing people into the process of making this game, and how it works internally. Here I can talk about my influences, what I listened to, read and watched, while making Black Crown. Not everyone will be interested in this, but we are starting to live in a more artisanal society, and there will be plenty who wish to understand the process. 

- There could be a separate roleplaying forum where posters take on the roles of the denizens of a mythical place that the Institute has destroyed, and roleplay in a collaborative environment. 

- We have not thought about accessibility for this project whatsoever. Deaf and blind players should be catered for in some senses, though this may need to be down the road in terms of development. The text could be read by mellifluous voice actors, with a setting which allows turning this on or off at any point in the Institute.

            <Title>Entry 5 - Notes On A Compass</Title>
            <Text>February 23rd (Written Directly Into Journal) Have realised that my compass is useless; as I lie in bed, it moves one way, and then the other. This morning the Sun seemed to rise in the North. North is now East? Ask Mayor. It would not be the first time that I have seen a community determine magnetic direction by means other than sense. Despite pleas to reason I am forbidden from intervening. A few lines break, and then a different pen and a slightly more manic hand. Have asked Mayor. He told me that there was nothing wrong with my compass. He even asked for it as a gift, in an awkward moment that these people seem to relish, and I had to mutter apologies and complaints of sickness in order to leave. Lots of small and large scribbled diagrams, full of calculations on date, position and time, and on theme of compass points, astrology, and other attempts to render sense in the town's geography. The mountain is apparently north Analysis :://89482304908RJND. Phyrrotite region, designated String Settlement? Not Conclusive. - What is the basis for this. It is the grandest peak - what a ridiculous assertion! I have seen children clicking their fingers towards it as they leave their homes for school - a game? A rite of passage? Pubescent transformation? More interviews. -Magnetic field? -Sulphur? -Technology? (crossed through) – too advanced. No evidence of quantum logistics that one can see. But those damn machines! I know that they exist! -Magic? Proven in Avalon (Faerie) though there affected only one's mind, not geography itself – consistent with Prospero's Law. Reminder: Samples tomorrow. A small, scribbled map of the town, and a point marked with a cross out to the west, and a small drawing of a deep pool surrounding a small island, with a picture of iron-clad boots, a harpoon and a lobster pot next to it.</Text>
            <Notes>I am still not sure how electricity reaches the town; I have seen no generators, and few wires, only those that string between houses when there are parties that I am not invited to. But if I could disprove it all an essayist, a professor a new Mendelev! A caliph of space and time! The old sorceror has spent too long on his pedestal anyway. Ferdinand saw to that.

            <Title>Entry 6 - K!K!K! 1</Title>
            <Text>I cannot understand how I have been here nearly a month and have never heard of K!K!K!, the sport which everyone seems to adore but never watches, or speaks of, especially not to outsiders. It appears the 'season' is upon us, and now I cannot traverse Main Street without incessant caterwauling reaching me from the tavern and from shop fronts of current players, fashions and gambles, all taking place upon a pitch that they nor I have ever seen, yet takes up more area than the town itself. Why they are forbade from spectating is utterly mystifying. They string great banners between the street-lights and across the narrow alleys of the Old Quarter, showing a wavering line traversing trees and ending in a lineal maze that seems to have no significance other than itself. There are strange, shelled jellies on sale by the dozen, wrapped in quilting that are sold from stalls that seem to have transferred via osmosis from the slum flats, and the hawkers are quite extraordinary; fat grandfathers whose lower arms are completely obscured by a clear membrane, as if they have been birthing a calf and quite enjoyed the affectation. The name is indeed strange, even by the standards of this singular place; I do wonder if they have any knowledge of what such a name would mean to anyone of wider travel and historic interest. I have asked several people as to its true meaning, and am told that it is something like a command, or an announcement. The closest approximation I can find in the town library's records is the phrase “Mother Is Asleep”. Such an ejaculation, as usual, is to me senseless; I tire of this town's impenetrability. Nonetheless, the game seems to strike some sort of happy panic amongst them, and I cannot ignore it any longer. Neither Friend, nor her father, nor the Mayor, would tell me anything interesting about it, either sworn to secrecy or ignorant of its intricacies. It seems the only person willing to speak to me is Spider's Nest In Barn. He told me that there was very little documentation on the sport (as seemed to be his answer for everything; I sometimes wonder why the town bothers maintaining a library at all), and that as an outsider I was unlikely to understand it, and that I should really just go back to my apartment and stop questioning everyone; people had enough to worry about. The old fart was being rather rude, and after more questioning, and a short disciplinary dig into his flat foot, he relented, and began to tell me what he knew. He told me little, perhaps not the whole truth, but enough to make it worthwhile. His knowledge seems archaic and mostly obsolete by the standards of others. It is a game quick to evolve, and bewildering even to those who had been brought up with it. However, I found myself much more capable than the librarian gave me credit for. From what I gathered the sport is less a competition and more a mass theatrics, albeit theatrics that no-one but the players witness; I had seen similar rituals in Pyongyang, but never at this scale or with this absurdity. Apparently, depending on who one asks, it began as a simple ball game amongst the youth of the town, who liked to disappear into the forest for days at a time; sanctioned legend says that it was one of several gifts passed down to the people by some dimly-remembered faqir named Whisper. I am surprised that a town of such proportions and apparent civilisation would still put such stock in prehistoric ideals; there is a poetic there, but one that even I find abhorrent. Nowadays the game of an arenal, a series of challenges to be overcome by the participants on an individual basis; much like that of the Moroccans in Rome, or Minos' contests, though far greater in scale and ambition than these or anything I have witnessed. Everything about it warbles change, mutability, and the unpredictable. The season is announced at a seemingly random time (which explains my entire ignorance of the thing until now), and the prospective players can apply to the Mayor, in person, to take part in the match. Though I am unsure as to the selection procedure, if they are accepted they must pledge to leave behind their ordinary lives and devote themselves to the game, for however long it lasts. Again, this is an unknown figure; games, he says, can continue for years. I asked where such lack of observation and stricture comes from; I explained that where I was born, rules and restrictions were very much a part of life. Spider seemed very interested, asking me more about my home, whether anyone killed themselves, whether women were allowed outside, and seemed to chew on the word “police” like it was arcane, something that gave him power. I still have not seen any evidence of law enforcement here; whether this is a quaint anachronism or genuine harmony no-one will tell me, at least with any coherence. The people of Loss are quick to laugh, though much of what they tell me, no matter how ridiculous, is accompanied by stony gravity. I pressed for more details on the game itself, how it is played, but was met with incomprehension and bewilderment. I asked if anyone would ever try to sneak into the pitch, to see it with their own eyes. Spider waved this idea away, saying that people were happy, and always would be. He is a very stupid man, sometimes. I do not think he has ever met a young person, perhaps not even when he was young himself. He was ruffled and ill-tempered by this point; he was not good at company, and even less good with books (I have seen him eat gruel over an open manuscript, and I felt like screaming when a splash oozed its way into the spine). He told me that it was mainly young men that were picked; I also learnt that I was living with two former players, the serious young men Discovering Leprosy and Love For All Gods; he called them buffoons and fond of women, but admitted that they had been great players, in their day. I have made a note to arrange an interview with them. This is next to useless. As I have already mentioned the pitch is forbidden to everyone but match officials and the players themselves. I remembered my first day, high on scree with the Mayor spluttering and gifting me laryngitis as I breathed in minty air and saw the leviathan forest that stretched past where I could clearly see, the bottle-green canopy broken occasionally by an alien shape, as if an ecosystem had grown in some vast rustling ocean that I was not privy to, a slice having been dropped and fossilised in rarefied alpine climes. I made a resolution to hike to the forest edge, to see, as they say, what I could see. It was late by then, and Spider was mumbling into his chest, occasionally fiddling at his conical, downy skull, constricted – I imagine – by his mother's thrifty womb. It looked like he was slowly slurrying into his waistcoat, as it often does when old men grow weary. He was mumbling about a herald, a town crier, a trumpeter, and at this I started in my reverie and questioned him, prodding him from eventual sleep. He gestured at the window and pointed away to the southwest, up a trio of mountains that had grown clenched, almost tense together, as if seeing something on their far side that we would not know. Through the mounting dark I could see the nerves that the lights in a house make, far up in the mountains, alone and almost monastic. Finally, it was explained! What had woken me at dawn every day since my arrival, that atavistic nuisance which made me think of trolls and long tunnels in the earth, but the town crier. Apparently he announced and closed the games with a great yodelling trumpet constructed into the roof of his quarters. He appeared to announce everything else in town as well. Perhaps he announces his own bowel movements. The frequency of his blasts, so to speak, would attest to this. Spider said that the man had a door that led out into the world from his house. That he peered through it, and called back down for others to follow him, but that his invitations were lost in the wind. I bid Spider goodnight; he is growing tired of me. I doubt I will gain much more from him.</Text>

            <Title>Entry 7 - Recipes</Title>
            <Text>I visited the kitchen of a famous chef today Doubthood Becomes :/// 000998834893 Standard Eremite Entry Format - ://Personal Response: Given the date and data there is much to be distrusted. The fanciful ingredients alone render it moot.. She may be the worst chef I have ever met. I believe these recipes were what caused the only real sickness I have had in all my time in Loss. They were a special, darling sort of disgusting - the musk of eggs and rollmops in milk rolled downhill in rusty barrels previously used to store the knotted viscera of Timur's conquests. Cat Caught In Griddle is very old, and very small, and seems to have a point about herself where gravity collects, a dint in some hidden magnet. She gathers there, and apparently was once very beautiful. I cannot see the genealogy of such beauty. She keeps a great, round room in the First Loss, the only one that is occupied, high in the penthouse from which she winches meals down to the field children who wait there like cats. There are no lifts, and I blinked rubber-sweat from my lashes as I loped up to Room E967. The interior of this scimitared profile is a familiar bastion of panelled wood and long, low rooms with no furniture; Friend says that it has all been used for scaffolding. Before I ascended I noted that above the reception desk, unmanned and covered in tarpaulin, was a portrait; the man posing, though it was impossible, was Abraham Lincoln, shaking hands with someone beyond the frame. His clothes were different, much smoother, dyed and whorled, and like something a mage would wear. He bore a wide smile, and looked around thirty or forty. It couldn't have been him, but there is still a nagging doubt in the pit of my stomach. I was told that Cat Caught likes sweet tastes, and light fragrances, and so I bought her gifts from the odd confectioners in the old town; there are a pair of them, Weak And Goud’s, and apparently it is a most venerable law that customers cannot shop in one alone, but must spend money in both. I brought her beet-toffees from one and a black liquid, sealed in a clear bag, from the other. They have great signs shaped like war-arrows that point to their competitor, inviting people to enter, and placards that change daily, singing the praises of their partner in balladic tones. A very odd edict. Her quarters occupy the entire top floor of the hotel, and from under the door infiltrated a base, churned odour, a smell of sex. She answered my knock, and did not greet me, or shake my hand, but merely beckoned me inside. My first impression was that there seemed to be little food in the old woman's home, though the apartment was dominated by the largest Mother Kiln I had ever seen, larger even than the canteen-denizens of the worker’s huts, gross with furred grease, a bronze tongue lapping from her dot of a mouth. I was close enough to examine the protuberance at the base of the Kiln; the hands of the relief were moulded into grasps, and they were in position at each side of the tap, as I realised it was. I was under no illusion any more; this mother was a war-father, an angry ravisher, and her proud member defied all those who, like myself, proscribed gender upon her. Cat Caught told me, opening her mouth for the first time, that she was only living here until her husband came home. I wondered how they transported the kiln up here - there is no dust around its base, and there are hand-prints in the patina. The old cook took bowls from a rack above the kiln and put them under the tap; a soupy fluid, tiny elements suspended in each drip, percolated down. I realised that the meat that they cooked in these ovens for days at a time were merely like the shells of acorns, syrupy amphora for fat. This was boiled out and collected in some hidden reservoir, to be used as soup, as stock, as cooking oil; every dish she told me of used it in some way. Fat is important to them, a practical ubiquity and a social lubricant in the very literal sense. She cooked me lye balls for lunch, taking great scoops of fat down from wood tubs and throwing them into a glowing pan. There was some insult of gods. She cooks a separate dish for her statue of a god of premature ejaculation, and then takes it behind a screen, and re-emerges some minutes later, re-arranging her smock and mixing it with a willow-stick. I am used to such behaviour by now. She gave me a bowl which I dug into to simulate eating. When I left she forced me to take it home, though I threw it into the river as soon as I could, where perhaps it formed the basis of a nightmare-tradition for crustaceans. The smell was in my mask for days. I longed to hang it out my window. I stole these from her cookbook to feed my worst enemies and their children and the grandchildren of their children. (The following is presented on torn notebook pages, in a hand very small and neat. The pages are splattered with food). Oh Carbonate! Oh Carbonate! - No socks or shoes - Cat gut (To The C-Word!) - Ice, Crushed, Assorted Flavours - Rye (15 husks) Place the rye in your pocket least-used, put on your no-socks before your no-shoes, the ice must be placed in a bag at your brow, and on the gut pluck out the song of the Now. Guests should be seated at this point. First Course LYE BALLS For twelve guests. 10 Onions, Field Or Cave 12 Radishes 10 Beet 15 Scatterbird Fillets, Or 1 Abbot Breast (Diced) 12 Quarts Of One’s Own Fat, Or From A Lover’s Middle (Reduced To Silkiness) 6 Pinches Of Paprika Various Rock Salts Brandy Springwater Cow Cream (An Unholy Jugful) Breast fat, especially from sad girls, is probably the best – a three month diet of liver and courgette flowers will produce the silkiest lipid. The arms of a Slender Man Doubthood Becomes ://// 000099833495 Standard Eremite Entry Format ://Personal Response: Another chimaera that he has conveniently forgotten to mention before?, plucked fresh and exorcised, is a worthy substitute in the summer months when bulk is nowhere to be found. The scatterbird dicings should be sliced, drowned in whiskey, and then boiled for three months to reduce to a golden syrup. Fry the onions, beetroot, and radish, mix the cream and springwater to a jealous paste, and introduce the brandy and rock salts. Pour on the hot fat and set before moulding into balls and finishing in the oven. Serve on fluted plates facing West. The paprika is for your own tongue. Second Course ECLIPSE PIE A summer dish. Use as much of each ingredient as you can find. Pastry Flour Butter Water Milk Shortening Filling Marmoset (A Whole Pack, To Reduce Distress) Doggerel Hound (Any Kind) Goblin Whale Warhound (To Be Stored Separately From Other Hounds To Reduce Spoilage And Massacre) Spices And Herbs Pertaining To Your Family History Cages, Thick Bars, Strong, Assorted Mix the pastry and spread, as a base, from the West To The West, throughout the whole valley. Build up the walls, using palisades if necessary, and finally place the lid with great ceremony, remembering to pierce air-holes as one goes. The crimps should hug the tree-line. The meat, still living, should be rubbed with the herb mix using brooms and mops and kept in secure cages. The temperature will be high enough after two months, and the meat ready to eat after four months. Divide the dish by family, or dynasty. The glacier will store any leftovers for at least a century. Third Course THE APOCALYPSE CHAMBER An allegory of the End Times, created in the heart of an ox. The ox must be old, and melancholy; four days in a cellar will help this. A lack of sunlight is vital; ultraviolets will broil the dish beyond repair. Feed the ox for three weeks on sugar, marrow syrup, melted butter and sibilant jelly. The animal may well die; if not, slaughter it and speak for it and embrace it for a week. Cut it in half, and remove the veins and capillaries, laying them out separately and ordered, though still attached to the heart. Now the kneading must begin. This can take a further two weeks, less with help; one must begin with the capillaries and their fronds, moulding the contents back towards the heart. A good technique is necessary, otherwise the mix will separate and be absorbed. As the capillaries empty, rub the tertiary, then the secondary, and the primary veins until the arteries closest to the heart are full to dripping. The heart must then be packed to capacity. After this, pluck the heart from the now-desiccated network. The heart should be oiled, wrapped in grease-paper, packed with soil and submerged in water for a further week. Serve the heart to no more than four people, with tree-sap to dip. It should never be served to foreigners, for fear of their own hearts finding too much peace in the allegory. After dinner, a trek to the Feeble Zeniths, along with processions of trumpeting, costumes and sweet dill, has been proven to aid digestion and memory.</Text>

            <Title>Entry 8 - K!K!K! 2 </Title>
            <Text>A bad day at every turn. Friend has been in some sort of state for a few days; whether it is Charybdis stirring things once again, or I have actually done something wrong, I do not know. I can recall nothing. Women, wherever they are and whoever they pray to and whatever they stick through their areola, are all the same. I bought her a present from the small souvenir shop in the First Loss Hotel, and wrote her something of my own. Even this won't bring her around; she accepted it with a tight smile, and went back up to her room. I do wonder if there is someone else, a little backwoods boy that guffaws when she lets him sniff her. The weather is appalling, a sort of wet mist, and I can see nothing from my window. I resolved to try and speak to Spider's Nest In Barn; if he was still in his filthy mood I believed that I could torment some answers out of him. Surprisingly, as he made the library door materialise, he was perfectly happy. Whether he feeds on misery and mist like some sort of celibate incubus I do not know. It is not a wild theory; he is a pathetic fallacy that confounds all. He was very willing to speak to me, and I thought it was as good a time as any to ask more about K!K!K!. It had been a keen subject all over town recently, but I was not privy to any match gossip. He seemed to be polishing a photograph, but would not let me see, and locked it away in an armoire before sitting with me before a table, across which was scattered the library's paltry offerings on the sport, like a man with too little hair to cover his skull. According to one Laytunt Pracsees Of Noball Sport, its author unknown and its spine cracked, the pitch is completely surrounded by thickets of evergreen woodland, a First Age crop that seems to be almost prehistoric in genesis. I asked to see a map of the layout, but was told that the mayor had the only copy, and used it as a doodle pad to improve cogitation in key matters. I balked at this irresponsibility, but Spider said that it was in fact rather encouraged; any changes that the Mayor made to the map during his term would be added, in actual construction, to the pitch for the next season's match. Only the Mayor, however, knows of the whole geography of the arena, and the labourers are blindfolded and fiercely guarded when actually building these impulsive structures. He told me of Buying Groceries In The Sun, a rather clumsy burgher of a hundred years or so ago, who set his wet coffee mug down and inadvertently added a vast arena to the north-east of the pitch. Apparently the thing took three years to build, and the workers were sworn to utter secrecy, with some actually being dragged to execution for refusal to keep silent. Any such change to the pitch, or the rules, is usually a celebrated happen-stance, and is to be taken very seriously, though the populace must be jubilant from a distance, watching the silent green mass of the pitch edge from across fields and through the filter of pure rumour. The players are divided into two teams, though it is entirely unnecessary; each player is awarded far more aplomb if he works on his own, and is encouraged to lie to and deceive everyone he encounters in the field, even his own team-mates. When I asked Spider what the point was of calling the groups “teams”, or even having groups at all, Spider responded by retreating going to boil us bones for tea in a tiny samovar in his cubby, and leaving me with two thin pamphlets, both coloured with shellac. They seemed to be a pair – the front cover of one showed a network of veins, leading the page and continuing on the next pamphlet, where they became connected to a set of legs, amputated at the waist yet seemingly in jubilant motion, skipping along a dirt road amongst finely detailed trees. I did wonder if authors and artists in this place were reluctant, embarrassed even, to autograph their work; art, here, is treated much like a penchant for cats and selective gardening was viewed when Richard was king. Below I have included a sketch of a K!K!K! Player found pressed into one of the pamphlets, showing him in total arraignment. The kit itself is simple; light cotton smocks, braces to hold it all up, or in, in the case of the fat ones, more like the gym wear of a child than anything else. The player's names are emblazoned in heralds across their chests; their names, in fact, the only thing that the players are not allowed to lie about whilst playing the game; Spider states that anyone found to have obscured their chests, with mud or their clothing whilst playing, is dealt with most harshly. The amulets and fetishes strung about the example below are personal taste, and vary from player to player; as always, K!K!K! players take their superstition seriously enough. Mobility is often impaired by the triptychs, illuminated images, necklaces, pendants and scrolls secreted about the player's person. The staff is wreathed in lightning strips, though I found this no surprise; these symbols are fast becoming tiresome in their ubiquity. The hood and boots, in the shape of a bird's talons and beak, are personal to the player depicted, a certain philanderer of several generations past, a Yipping Dogs Bellied Sun who was forced into the game, so the text states, to “soothe his underside with a lack of caves and glut of trees and air.” I have found other players, and their costumes, in further illustrations, incorporating elements of mythology, zoology and even gastronomy as sartorial inspiration. One particular example had his entire head covered by a elephantine gland, arching out over his back and constantly dripping steam from his panting breath. There were scratches in the paper beside the drawing. The small sphere tied at the waist is called the Cerebellum Clandestin, and seems the most important part of the game. Within is contained, on a spiralling, microfilmic canvas, the entire life story of the player, in excruciating detail, down to the last minuscule action, related to an independent official in a long series of talks before the player even begins a match. I am not even sure what it would be used for, though, I suppose, that is down to the player entirely. I should love to get my hands on one. I asked Spider if he had any more books. The secrecy and lack of exposure is maddening. He completely ignored the questions, passing me a mug of grey gristle and water, and asked me whether I had met the Mayor's wife yet. I took this to be a joke, or an insult, and tried to ask him what he meant, but he told me that he had to tidy up, and took my mug back from me, pointing to the door. I noticed that a complicated series of pulleys and ropes lifted the whole wall panel free with a swiftness that belied its primitive construction, and noiselessly the menhir was gone, and I was outside. and made my excuses and left. The mist had resolved itself into rain, and great sheets of it undulated over to the west, wetting the treetops of the pitch and waking its denizens, ready for the players to be announced, or to disappear. I must try and speak to the two men from my building; they might be willing to actually tell me something useful.</Text>

            <Title>Entry 9 - The Hidden Press</Title>
            <Text>The Hidden Press The following has been stencilled into the notebook, the scriptural font copied in running ink: Brought to us by the benefaction of that priest and guide His Highness Peter Parley (Here is found a rough approximation of Samuel Griswold Goodrich) THIS MUST BE BY WRIT THE HIDDEN PRESS IN HISTORY COMMISSIONED BY MOST UNHOLY WHISPER IN THE YEAR THAT WE ARRIVED IN THE HOME FOR HATRED AND HE DEPARTED FROM US IN A COLUMN OF STEAM, HOOTING. BEING THE FIRST AND ONLY BOOK OF ALL BOOKS, THAT BEING ALL NECESSARY, WITH ONLY ONE PROPHECY, THE FIRST PROPHECY AND THE ONLY ONE THAT, IN THE END, PERHAPS MATTERS THE VERSE RUNS. WE DIE ETERNALLY SO THAT THE GODS MAY NOT HAVE US. For MAN was perverted. For MAN was sacred. For MAN was gross. For MAN sired mothers. When the beginning was merely a poem in the tonsils of man-augurs there was MAN. We dove sonorous, and rose gracious. Our eyes rollicked with the plains-factory of pulleys the might of mountains, and these pulleys winched light into pupils the un-size of black holes. Time was thrown backward at each step, and so we was still. And we was the colour of a wall of none, and quasars formed when we rubbed against our brothers on those few occasions when we shook hands. We had warts, and we call these suns after the love we felt. And our brain was a deep-precinct, a complex of thousands of markets of blinking gas-civilisations. Here life was. And in this life there was worry, and in that worry perfection fell. And so MAN was betrayed by himself. And so MAN did betray himself, and doubt that which he had made. We wished to rest, and though we rested we found no time to rest again. We wished friends that were not like us. We wished MAN to have his equals. Oh, how great we were, how kind and humble. Hear our warning, and the tearing of vacuum as we weep. And so it happened, hear this, it happened, that half of MAN tore off their tails, the seat of them, and hurled them into the void, and these tails became the gods, and they were fatty and small, with the nugget of gristle that we bear in the commonest of sewers. This is what others called them, bringing them to the level of the most underdeveloped node in the mind of the Great Retard. We call them, instead, (the following long word is crossed out, seemingly in the original text). Here WHISPER joins us. He is not WHISPER. He was merely one of us then, and in him was such a reactor. And so it was that he called the gods poor in spirit and wealth, and named them enemy. But he would not be heeded. Hear our warning, and the slapping of our backs as we weep. But the gods were fatty and small, and many, and dark against the dark of night. And with no warning war was made, and stars winked out, and the crown was stolen. The Abdication was short, and the crown was black and now it is white in their small hands, bleached by erosion and the dying of us. And so it was that the gods murdered us. Their chatter was reason and it stung us. Their barbs were small but they grew colonies in our innards and our atoms and waged war there. And those Long Men who had given their tails threw ourselves at the void; we grew our hair long and wore chains spun with bulging novae around our chests. We would now die. We would now birth the next line of man; though they were webby and red with stuff when they were birthed. We were disgusted. We were disgusting. Hear our warning, and the death of us as we weep. And thus we were murdered, and our blood fell as fire and water to the new earth and the new moon, and scarred them and turned them liquid. The moon now sulks, barely a child, and not yet a man, nursing his wounds that will heal. Man bless the Teenage Moon and his moods. And so MAN fled to this Earth, and shrunk himself to wedge into the caverns and calderas that now were the ground. The fire moved in rivers and MAN squabbled in his new, childish form, giving us death and the fear of death.

We are only man. And then so it was that WHISPER joined us, disguised and small amongst his people. And he gathered those of us he loved (for he loved not everyone, and hated many) and led them to a ring of fire that spat and died; and from this fire and WHISPER'S deep breath a mountain formed, and another, and another, and like battlements they grew and hid us. The gods amused themselves tossing their new ash-crown from head to head, and the shadow hid us at last. And so he told us this story, that we may read it to our young. And so he built us houses that we may be closer to home. And so he taught us lies that our speech may hide us. And so he taught us sport that we may be the past still and walk as far as we may. And he made us statues of the oldest phlegm behind our pendulum that we may blow smoke into their faces, when we have cleared our throats. And so he taught us language that we may shout inside it. And so the white crown sees the land and all it has made, and yet it does not see us. May the white be black again. May man be MAN. May we have our throne back. May the gods fail their lovers and be lonely. May outsiders be damned. May man be MAN. May we never be friends with the world, or those in it, and may they never harm us. Hear our warning, and the tearing of vacuum as we weep.</Text>
            <Notes>A tracing taken from one of Spiders few books. More of a pamphlet, really. It was well hidden for what passes as holy scripture here, tucked inside a Haitian trade-proof copy of King Solomons Mines, and extricated only with the uterine rumblings of Spiders ravaged little throat. Where is this demagogue machine? None have mentioned it, and the dedication appears to be extraneous. I should like to meet this Parley. I believe that I read of a Parley in the libraries of Thoth - an ancient publisher-king? A locomotive? Why did they not follow him? And where were the tracks taken as he disappeared up these slopes? There seems to be a third-party peep here; a rather hushed and reverent Q, removed from Whisper by fathoms, or doctrines, or planes. It seems odd, that some of them bury their dead; cremation would be far more in line with this impersonal, Potters Field approach. Must get to the bottom of this abject hatred of deities that these people have. At least such hatred goes some way to explaining the lack of any kaba, no Swedenborgian passing of indeterminate boredom. They reveal themselves as humanists at last. A rather confusing syntax; the people of Loss obviously identify with this capitalised Man; I have never seen a religious text that is so self-congratulatory. Tails? Is this it? Do we console ourselves with cosmological difficulties by growing tails? Like base lizards? Like that damned Green; his head full of scales on pinstripe. So far has this delusion gone that there is now an ingrained social anxiety around these Long Men Tails, as I have heard those curious paper bolts named. Or am I witnessing an avian morphology at work? Such a tirade could not have been dealt with lightly. Did Whisper bring about the war, about to break in the text? I have seen pictoral references to such a thing all over the town; on the chests of scatter-beaters, the pinnacle of the First Loss, and the crest of them all, that they pledge allegiance to silently, at intervals unknown to me. (Here the Eremite has merely drawn tens of minuscule drawings of male genitalia, with varying degrees of accuracy). Childbirth? It certainly sounds like it. The most terrifying realisation of a primitive culture is that the process that renews them seems not natural, not beneficent at all, but is rather barbed, and feverish, and rakes the borders of falling asleep forever. In any case, the Long Men would be women, here. So straightforward! So open, with no need for my Matthew or Mark at my side! Indeed, as I have witnessed, this is a patriarchal excuse. The narrator seems female, however. A fetishism - the idols of the discarded organs strew this town like webbing or gound. What an odd, generational shame. Perhaps explains the lunar pendant I was given on my first day by the rover-walker - the scalloped surfaces certainly feels like acned skin. Would we explain the moons cycles this way? N.B. the recording of the grocer arguing with me that the moon never changes, and that all I need do is watch it in the sky. A joke at my expense. Nothing menstrual or feminine; merely the mood swings of petulant youth, ashamed of his disfigurement and forced to slope around this young world forever. The Teenage Moon. How refreshing! How refreshing!</Notes>

            <Title>Entry 10 - The Graveyard</Title>
            <Text>Friend has spent much of the last month with me; it is a rare day that I do not see her. The girl is pleasing to sit with; she does not ask me many questions of the outside world, and is content to tell me what she knows of her town and her home. However, though she is lovely to look at she is quite stupid, and what she knows is very little. Perhaps it is just that she is young. She tells me that she is three hundred, and is prone to laughter followed by murmuring storm-fronts of anger that seem to last for true aeons, over the most trivial things – a stubbed toe, myself letting a door shut behind me before she has followed. We spend hours on the fourth floor tributary. I once stepped into the stream to investigate the hatch from which the water pours – I know that the river, nameless and a trickle as it enters the canals of the residential district, flows into the building at ground level; a great roar is heard at the cistern, and the sound of cogs and gears, and then this, a lazy brook that meanders across the high floor of the flat. The wood beneath my feet was varnished and pitted with purple algae that sprouted heads of water broccoli. Someone has planted chicory in long rows, and Friend lets her pet rodent, a mouse-like thing that materialises every few days, scurry about the raised beds, pecking. She seems to wear the same clothes everyday, yet they remain so clean! A green slip, floral, tied with Long Men Tails, jagged so that they press into the little hump of her stomach. I imagine they leave little divots like the feet of robins. I should like scratch them in that way that make her toes crinkle. It is quite odd to think of the uses that these makeshift genitals have; they adorn the waists of girls, the thresholds of shops, and the nets of the fishermen. I have yet to unravel the rather odd relationship the town has with the “Long Men”; that is to say, as my research has shown me, women. She is small, and I imagine we look quite comical, strolling through town, a golem and his slender rabbi. Her eyes are very, very dark and she has a broad face, a face made for tattoos or scarification, and she has hair on her forearms, the sign of true beauty. Her teeth are bad, and she hides them, scowling usually, a twitch in her lip pulsating. Her breasts already have some of the hang that they could keep for the rest of her days, and my attempts at lust have a flavour of maintenance about them; I aim to provide lift. She grows her nails long and tries to hide smiles when she breaks them. I think she likes the noise they make. We went to meet her father at work the other day; the graveyard is past the Old Town and is burrowed into its own patch of wilderness, past a fence tied with Long Men's Tails and wildgrass between two homes that are connected by a bridge of overhead rungs at the height of the second floor. On the dusty path we passed small yurts, wreaths of smoke coming from them; naked men emerged periodically and ran into the woods, yelling. My questions went unanswered; she is too young to know what they do. Friend tells me that these parts are the home of huge, venomous spiders that wreak terrible havoc on the colonies of mice that burrow under the tree bark. I have never seen them. Someone had hung salmon, dried and many years old, in the branches of some of the larger trees. I smell carrot, rich and almost radioactive in its intensity, and I know that it is wild and black. We reached a set of simple gates, created from ancient pollards that had grown into thick barriers. A rope hung there, tied with a stone for weight, and as we pulled it the gate rose, clicking and chirruping its way into notches cut to hold it. The path is cobbled here, the grass spongey and lush in that way that points to frequent digging. The graveyard is a deep hollow cut into the valley floor many years before, and part of the mountain that rears above it. How the townspeople made such a depression without heavy machinery is beyond me; but I am learning not to question everything that I see here. I have plenty of time to find where they keep the trebuchets and cranes. Friend's father was eating bacon by the rasher in his hut. A dirty spade rested against him, clanging as his leg jumped to some interior beat. The graveyard has as much of a deliberate topography as the residential district; some of the steles and tombs rise many storeys, crowned with dioramas of winged men, women gripping swords, and gods with minuscule genitalia. The writing on them, both the Tachygraph and Latinate script, were many feet high, and whirled and dipped into each other like a debate between simpletons. Here is a great geometric legacy, one which I cannot interpret. The only word that makes any sense to me is “cough”, repeated at several key architectural points in these tholos-structures. A huge, reclining man is carved in a single piece basalt near the centre of the compound, leaning into a crouch as if he is about to spring at the mountain, to tackle it back below ground. Deep in his perineum is the tell-tale weathering of many hands thrust in superstition, and embossed letters spell out CHERNOBOG. Inaccuracy:// REF 80GFIO110::/ Чернобог “Black God” - West Slav Denomination 12DWQ Mr. Light barked at me not to wander, as it was not right that I should even be in such a place. Through the morning fog I could see terraces rising up the mountain, obelisks and crypts widening into great complexes, much like at Karnak or Thebes; however, here and there wild hares ranged between the plots, and the grass is lush and thick. There was a sweet smell on Mr. Lights breath, and all around me. He had hung rows of phylacteries, white and black, on copper railings around his hut, and I finally asked what they were for. He looked at me with something approximating acceptance, perhaps for the only time in our acquaintance, and told me that some people take a pinch of the grave dirt with them after they have buried their dead; it is worn on the arm or the forehead, and consulted for key decisions and celebrations. This really leaves me none the wiser, though the perceived importance of his task is clearly what buoys him up; he seems like a man that could sag at any moment. I told him of the Jews having a similar practice, and he looked quizzical and nervous, as if he had been told that the meat he ate at dinner was human flesh. Friend finished talking to her father, and, quite amazingly, they shook hands; queerer and queerer! As we left I asked her why she had done what she had done; she took my hand, then, for the first time, and told me that she had said goodbye. She was treating me like an idiot. I asked her if she kissed her father, or if he kissed her, and she slapped me lightly on the shoulder, as far up as she could reach, and dragged me back towards town, where we bought strange meat. I asked her if she knew what a kiss was. There are a number of scratchings of figures and equations, and a mysterious chemical diagrams, showing bonds, valencies, elements and constant calendars of time passed and time still to pass. The scratchings are desperate and panicked. From this point on in the diary they begin to appear in the margins of entries, on the backs of maps and drawings, and inside the suitcase itself.</Text>

            <Title>Entry 11 - Alphabet</Title>
            <Text>As far as I can glean from the texts that I have read, the ceremonial tongue of Loss, which has no name (but for definition's sake will be called the Tachygraph), is one of the most brusque and yet expressive linguistic systems I have ever come across. It is quite different from the whale song of Ys, or the windy cancer-chatter of the Golden Temple. There is no waifness, no lightness of carriage across the tongue Ref:://7970932232434 ‘Truthful Exception’. Proceed with caution.. There are better halloos across the kingdoms; the spriggan were much fairer in speech than the dour folk I now co-habit with, especially when talking of their lower halves or war. But, as a language, the Tachygraph has its higher uses, especially in festival; the people of Loss usually speak excellent English, with a complete absence of accent. I had expected some shallow gutter tongue, designed for smaller lungs and cross-bred larynx (it is now evident to me that these people generally keep their morning-star close to the gauntlet, as it were; the most backward of them can barely breathe, yet are gifted tall, stately homes along the river from which they bellow and drip piss onto passers-by). In one of my interviews with the Mayor I asked him how the people of the valley came to use English as its tongue; were it not for the surroundings we could be in the hawthorn and cricket brush of Surrey. He waved the query away with an arachnoid digit, nearly catching my gas filter with his too-sharp nails, reciting this poem out onto his courtyard lawn where his son was playing with a curious instrument that whirled and spun: One tongue, one tongue, one tongue, one tongue, one tongue, one tongue, one tongue, one tongue! Whisper brings us invisible ghosts to hold. One tongue, one tongue, sky-rung, one tongue, one tongue, sky-rung, one tongue, one tongue! That teach us to speak like maggots on mold Teach gash to speak. Our lips are our wounds And our teeth the larvae. We open the stitches And out comes the marvels. Again, lies, misdirection, appalling verse, and glowering, spoilt silence. The basic roots of it all obviously reside in their absurd cosmology, though I have had no chance to discover how far their mistrust and evasiveness goes. The Mayor, of himself, is a liar, but a pleasant one, a fellow bibliophile and artisan – out there, beyond the elm windowpane and creamy glass he has had a small oak cloven in two in his garden, creating a space large enough for a small person. He constantly threatens his son that he will shut him up in there until his twentieth birthday; he makes for a fat Ariel, though. When I ask him of Death's father, he smiles before a gross melancholic sets in, and he starts to tap at the doors, the doors that lead to the organs of his life, his quarters and the bedroom of his son and missing wife. It seems that though English is their communication, with little to distinguish it in its usage, the Tachygraph is really all their own. The letter pattern is very limited. In any other place I would have said that they were too few, that no true understanding could have originated from such a bare tree. But this is Loss, and I am loath to attempt science when there is an air of confoundment that hangs around me like gas. This research comes from the Mayor's library, larger than that of the town, though I returned the books before they were missed. Unlike English, or many other Latinate languages, the Tachygraph does not have names for the letters themselves; the people of Loss find spelling very difficult, almost an existential crisis; for them, letters exist on their own, and cannot possibly be described using other letters. I am inclined to see their point of view. (These symbols are set out almost like illuminated manuscripts; they only slightly resemble the symbols used here to represent them). ! This, on its own, denotes surprise, beginnings, birth, sexual intercourse, art, farming and lightning, amongst other things. It seems to be considered something of a Prime Letter, if any such thing exists. Katyayana would have been almightily pleased that his theories were in practice somewhere in or of the world. ? The letter above represents confectionery, the Universe, debate, grief, etc. It is often used with the previous symbol to denote importance or confusion, and is, on its own, a malaprop; its use comes from the similarity, in sound, to an alingual cry of grief. As if acquiescing to such a tradition, it can be similar to the “eheu” or “ahem” in usage; an elemental expression, the scream or the grunt of a flood victim. . This is used for apocalypse, insects, crime, death and children. Often people describe this symbol as “lonely”, and I have seen it drilled into manhole covers and on the rear walls of public buildings. K This is used for departure, athletics, war, festivals and technology. Often written in rapid succession, such as in the game K!K!K!; the most extensive use I have found is the term to describe heterosexual marriage, which, amongst other letters, has 26 of these in its structure. Death of a Friend tells me that marriage is often avoided to avoid having to use this word at the ceremony, though I don't believe her. * I insisted on calling this “the star” for several weeks, much to the chagrin of the townspeople. The worst reaction was from Hammer And Black Thumb, the dentist. He seemed to have a special fondness for the letter, calling me an “iconoclast”, amongst worse things. It is used for official documents, medical matters, the sea, mythology and gods. The mayor’s ring is carved with one. () These are actually a pair of letters, though I have never seen one used without the other. Obviously, these are used to represent twins, duality, pairs or opposites, though their meaning is more complex than this. They can also mean loneliness (though I am told that it is a different kind of loneliness from that represented by the other symbol), singularity, or footwear, tumours or illness in general, or port duties and tax. The sole of every shoe has them cut into the grip. They appear to me like a mouth, kissing the earth. A Censor:// 0000000001 Signed: Level 16 Designation K.A.F.K.A (This letter’s appearance is irrelevant - it is crossed through many times). This is the “ohm” of the Tachygraph. I have seen it afforded no prime status but I believe it to be the most holy symbol of the Tachygraph – it is used extremely rarely, and with the same reverence that the transubstantiationalists place in wine and polythene. My only real encounter with this letter, and its use, came when I was helping the cinema workers reel in their screen from the river, keeping it clear of the icebergs; they were singing as they dragged, in long, single vowels repeated Ref::// 738673QW “Personal Note”::// Vowels and consonants seem a foreign concept to this tachybet, and so the Eremite seems incorrect in designating them status. We have no audio recording of the Loss dialect being spoken, and so can only speculate as to its full lexicon and its spoken complexities. If this is a fabrication, it is a lazy one.. When I then merely deigned to ask them what they were singing, they began laughing and slapping me about the back and shoulders, while I tried to help them! I immediately dropped my corner of the screen and left to recline under a nearby willow. One of them came to join me, ruffled my hair and grimly stamped on a large beetle, a Pageant Weevil and full of deadly venom. He picked a small fern (see below) that he told me would help if I ever was stung. I asked if it was to be ingested or used as a poultice, and he told me that in fact when ingested it is indeed more poisonous, and would hasten inevitable death. After silence as we gazed on the setting sun trying to glow through the miles of mountain rock, he said that he and his friends had been singing for their dinner. Many workers forgo meals for two or three days at a time, voluntarily, in order to keep their minds strong and focussed. When they did eat, he stated, their food was sacred to them, a reward and a fleeting pleasure that was not to be repeated for some time. The only way that he could render the practice in English was as the phrase “the meal that comes as if a great wind had smeared it over my lips”. He drew the letter for me, and sung it again, alone, though his fellows looked up and grinned when they heard him. It seems to represent finality, the termination of things, the close of day, or torture, derision or greed. I was at the time unaware of the valley's aversion to traditional worship, and asked if the phrase “manna from Heaven” came close. He lifted his foot, scraped the insect from the ground, and threw it at me, before turning to leave. I was quite startled, and flicked it with as much grace as I could into the alpine water. (Below this entry is a small, dried frond of fern, taped into the journal). There is not only a ritual aspect to the Tachygraph, but a quotidian necessity that I have discovered as well. Some of the letters are used everyday, in labyrinthine structures of tongue-work that form separate universes of un-faith for the speaker. There are warbles as stoves are prepared for breakfast, mumblings from between the ancient, cracked dice that the stooped gamblers hold in their mouths, by the orchestra (who seem unemployed for much of the year) speaking soothingly to the brass prows of their huge instruments. Some are meaningless or insulting when spoken alone, and one or two are reserved for official business and are rarely spoken by the populace at large. And yet there are so few! The rules as to their usage and nuances of meaning seem endless, and I doubt I shall ever understand them all. I befriended a group of nervous students on lunch-break from classes; they occasionally go for bone marrow at the butchers, or to scratch themselves under trees and sleep. Their uniforms are hair-shirts, long and cumbersome; I queried them as they shifted and itched in the heat, and they told me that the teachers make them wear them to promote distraction; in Loss, this is a key educational tool. I imagine that the poor creatures will try to think of anything other than their discomfort, and perhaps this is where genius strikes, in the red skin and endless, rustling fabric. I asked one of them, saving the pips from his apple to flick at his friends,whether it would be appropriate for me to attempt to write a poem in the Tachygraph. He told me that it is really nothing to do with him. I found this quite amusing, and he asked what I thought poetry had any business being near books at all. I went alone to the library. Spider spent most of the time peering over my shoulder, gibbering and shaking his head before disappearing to stare from a newly-installed window into the sun. Below is my effort. The translation is my own; it felt only right that I be the one to do so. (The poem is presented as dual translation, with the Tachygraph on the left and the English on the right. The Tachygraph has not been reproduced here, but the lines are corrected many times, and sometimes replaced completely). And how the gates are genius And how they tick-tock over our heads like Greek bingo wings Perfumed and with ducts As small as the mouths of oranges Which are turned up Lowing like cattle Cooing like anuses They handle cameras like animals to be drowned. I must show them And I accidentally catch them all, Slanted in their gateway As if about to fall off their valley. Their valley is perfumed, and they melt fat And semen to grease nets. The fish feed on tadpoles. Her father is a hunter and fisherman. She does not have a mother. He fucks the Mayor And that is how it is done. I am living in their building And I let my wood-smoke, The tin and kinetics of my burner Wind up to her, Covered in me Like Rapunzel, Or Baba Yaga I let down hair, Steal fingers, Rub my nakedness on the night And hers are on my windowsill Like flies, like flies, like flies. The townspeople had a meeting that evening that I was not invited to, and Friend refused to read the thing or even listen to me reading it. I retired to remove my mask, though before I did so she allowed me a rub of her outer thigh for my effort. I think she may be in love with me.</Text>
            <Notes>It is hard for me not to see these as punctuation. The name of Loss, in the Tachygraph, appears to be !?. if rendered as Latinate punctuation. This would seem to correspond to the phenomenon of loss itself; it is all there! The initial shock, the confusion and questioning, and finally the acceptance. Surely I am not the only one to see it? I must ask someone. Perhaps they mock me. They have done so before.</Notes>

            <Title>Entry 12 - K!K!K! 3</Title>
            <Text>We shared dinner in the common room this evening; of course I had to eat alone, in my room, but as soon as I was done and had replaced my mask I joined the group. Almost the whole building was there, though the quiet man and his daughter had apparently excused themselves as soon as they had finished eating and retired for the night. Some sat and chatted about things that required frenzied hushing and fidgeting with their dinner knives and lines of salt that they eventually brought to their mouths on wet fingers, snorting at the strength. The adults drink from dented tin mugs, but the children are given slender wooden tubes that, when blown into, produce a honk that sends them into fits of giggles. They let the fire burn down to a shimmer in the air before disappearing. I walked Friend to her room, and she kept trying to stop me in my pace, but I was itching to speak to Discovering Leprosy and Love For All Gods about K!K!K!; they were out at harvest almost every day, and this was the first opportunity that had presented itself in weeks. When I returned and tried to rouse them to conversation they were cagey and reserved, playing at some competition that involved them slapping each others hands like schoolchildren. Most people had gone to bed. They finally finished their game, and I poured them both coffee. Gods looked out the window, mostly, as if expecting somebody to cross the street, or perhaps sulking at his loss; it was hard to tell who had won the thing, they were both so grave. Leprosy was more open. He had done better as a K!K!K! Player, completing a match in less than ten years. Gods rose without a word and left for bed, without even nodding back at us. I saw him pocket something on his way out, something that sat heavy in his pocket. When he had shut the door Leprosy leant forward and told me that he had been dismissed from his match. I asked Leprosy to elaborate, but he refused. Their friendship is close, and mainly silent. They are, after all, farmers at heart. Though I am close to them, I'm still the Eremite. Maybe its the mask. I have been told that the children don't like it, that I look like a cow's skull on a stick. I asked Leprosy about the match itself; I still knew little of the actual mechanics. He pointed to the window, and told me that the town crier blew his horn at the start of every match, and at its close. The players are grouped at the Gables, elaborate huts that are almost like grand wickets, or an extensive warren that is “safe” in the style of Bulldog. He drew me a sketch on a scrap of paper I gifted him, though he is no artist, and I worry about his recollection; he has festooned it with fetishes, paintings of deities and sweeping beams. (Here is found a scrap of paper stuck into the journal, with a rough approximation of a tall hut, with many flourishes in its construction). Next the players line up, facing the tree line, the edge of the pitch, with a number of paths winding into the trees. They then sing Whisper's March, the ceremonial start of the match. It is a catchy tune, as close to an anthem as these people have, and you may often hear people whistling it as they work at meat or accounts, or hammer the beat of the middle eighth on the poles of their hoes. I set up my recording device before asking Leprosy to sing it, to provide me with something definite; out of guilt and pagan shock at seeing my device he began to recite it softly for me, barely over the whirr of the machine and the crackle of the fire, so as not to wake Kicking Sods Into The Sea, the tumour-ridden geriatric who doesn't seem to have a room in the building, but haunts the bathroom attached to the common chambers, pulling on the netty cord and playing the pipes like a marimba. He woke anyway, and grumbled and shoved us out, before returning to his sleep and his crisp toes, propped by the oven. Retiring to my quarters, I asked Leprosy to explain the small bottle hanging from the belt of the K!K!K! player in the picture I had found; he told me that it was a vial of scatterbird blood, caught and slain at the beginning of the match and given to the players to do with as they will. I asked him what he had done with his but he had merely shook his head, prodding at my Tarot harp. The pig-headedness of these people! He has a tendency to fiddle; he is nervous, slow by personality, uncharmed by celebrity; he resolutely ignores the girls that coo after him as he goes about his day. I asked him what he did when he was let into the woods, at the start of the match. He turned to me, smiled for the first time since I had met him, and told me that he had split from the group, and run off on his own. He is a very ugly man and rebellious, scared, feeble and foolish; from what I have heard, he is the best sort of player. He told me about Child Sleeps Through Fire, the first ever player to win K!K!K!, nine years after Whisper had supposedly given it to the people of Loss. He said that he had seen the champion, in the woods, two months into his first match. He had been in deep woodland, he said, and he had spied a ruined castle on the next rise; something ancient, perhaps Stygian, “the very type of wrong”, as he so eloquently put it. It had not stopped raining in two weeks, and as he searched for a way to cross the wide, lazy tributary that blocked his path, the man had floated up the river. I asked him if he was dead, and he said that I did not understand, that the man floated above the water, like Jesu or insect striders in my mind. He trailed his feet in the water, and floated straight past Leprosy, up and around the bend of the river. The water boiled as he passed. I could imagine him, trailing ribbons of prehistoric cotton, his staff lax in one hand, his body emaciated and and pulsating with sag. It seems that there were forgotten things in the woods, things that even the Mayor did not know about, but I grew tired of wondering who was lying. I asked him if this had happened. He told me that it had, and turned in my cubby where he had installed himself like a child allowed to stay up late. That was that. I could not ask him again. The way that the man had looked at me was enough. I never really understood, in all that he told me, how points were scored, how rivalries were settled, whether the teams really mattered at all; he told me about the Whisper Cross-Section, the great maze, the caves, the mountain and the Aground, a huge wrecked galleon sunk into the rock and filled with spirits; all of them are challenges to be overcome. He would not tell me who, or what they contained, what armour he wore, what swords he plucked, what maidens he kissed. I told him of Friend's theories that the pitch went under the mountains, under the town, under the river, beneath our very feet. He wiped the scar on his hand, the lateral one that has the shine of a pie casing, and swore at her, softly, smiling again. He called her a “civilian”, with every hatred. He too seemed to carry something. He was bent by it. He produced small nuts from his gown pocket, and as we ate we devised a game of flicking discarded shells into the corners of the small travel desk I had brought with me; the inkwells served as goals. The game (K!K!K!, that is) seems to end if the Mayor becomes bored, if any one of numerous prophecies is fulfilled, if the sun hits the bark of a certain tree in a certain light; there are many more conditions. The town crier is notified, and he blows his trumpet again, and the players must turn back from their journey, and return to where they began; like all good heroes must, I imagine. Leprosy took me to his room and showed me his vial of scatterbird blood; it was dusty and empty. He told me that when he heard the trumpet, he was the only one who made it back; he had lain a trail of blood, winding through trees, back home. He did not wink, and I knew that there was no Grimm contained amongst the Haggard and the yellowing Munsey in the library. Those who return to the Gables, whether triumphant warrior or dejected failure, are greeted by the Comeirh, a ceremonial, costumed role. His sketch this time was subdued, his hand hesitant, and there was a fearsome mismatch of beasts, a Nemean monstrosity, raised up on stilts and furnished with four legs, tusks – every protuberance imaginable. But what took me most were the eyes, and these he spent many minutes on, shading, filling with colour. They were dead, those of a puppet, this was sure; but the way that beasts can look through you was not present. They were the eyes of an accountant, of Anubis and Thoth, of a judge or your own mother, who treated you as the idiot son, the wastrel, or the runt. With all the solemnity of a Mason, he said that he was then asked to tell the Comeirh everything he had done in the forest. He had completed very few challenges, in all truthfulness; he had run, for the most part, lost, pissing in mulberry bushes. But he lied. He told the Comeirh of the Algebra Lizard, fighting haunted helmets, crossing the lake with his pole, bridges for mice, band-saws that walked and danced in great convents. It poured off of him like sweat. And he was believed. To this day he still receives gifts, letters of love, professions of admiration and endless favours from his fellow townsfolk, in an example of those minuscule religions that exist everywhere; he is like a saint, but almost opposed, the epitome of the deceit that is so integral to the game. He had nothing to drink, and it was that late, childish hour when men like to, so I led him back to my room and let him demolish my stores. I asked him about other matches, other players he had met; had he ever killed anyone? He cut me off, called me an arsehole foreigner, kissing me on the forehead; I did not think that he had drunk that much. He then climbed into my bed and fell loudly asleep. I tried to rouse him several times, but eventually left him and went walking. I climbed the building on light feet, but Friend's father was asleep outside her door, an extinguished cheroot on the floor beside him. He was dreaming of running or chasing, the way he was twitching, as a dog does. I thought it wise to go to Leprosy's bed. He had left his door unlocked, and I entered. A pile of letters was stacked on the desk, and the bed was slung with filthy clothes that blocked out the light and the husks of nuts long eaten. The desk held several rolls of maps and jars of pens, and I finally had time to study them. There were scrawls of wide ovals, burrowed penmanship, deep ink in the table, fury that he could not hide. He had scrawled names, questions, interrogations and interviews with himself into that paper. It seems that he was trying to draw the pitch from memory. - When he adds to the K!K!K! Map, things are not added in real life.</Text>
            <Notes>He looked at me sideways, and told me that the water in K!K!K! should never be touched; he told me that he had heard terrible stories.</Notes>

            <Title>Entry 13 - Things Worsen</Title>
            <Text>Something has happened to Friend; her behaviour over the last week has become more and more erratic. We were parading on the board-walk today, myself taking her hand before the scandalised eyes of the basking labourers, scared to be locked indoors, and, quite without merit, as I was speaking about my theories on the pointless derma-mythologising of cartographile skin cults, she pulled her hand away, snatched my armful of books and threatened to throw them into the river if I didn't desist. It is as if she has started to hate me. She called me an “boring old elephant” without knowing what one was. I had shown her a picture once from my journals and she had shown no interest, but now she uses this to hurt me. She does not know that it is quite pointless to try. I endured the staring eyes and managed to calm her down, lightly retrieving Spider's books from her grasp, before she strode ahead, pulling the sausage I had bought her from her pinafore, where it had stained in a wide oval as if the moon was up. We do not see the little girl and her father anymore; someone has shut their cubby and sealed it with nails. Today at breakfast I heard the sound of heavy machinery from the other side of the building, and the walls shook and dislodged dynasties of insects like mobiles of spare legs above my head. I thought that I would finally see the Byzantine mechanics that these people hide from me, but I was waylaid by old Kicking Sods, who blocked my path with an old broom and began asking for passwords and hexes and other such nonsense. By the time I got outside there was no more noise, and no tracks in the small gardens that rim the apartment blocks; I was defeated once more, and I also saw that the missing pair's room, their entire apartment, had been ripped from the building, as smoothly as one selects eggs from a shelf. I had only seen this once before, after the funeral of an old woman from a neighbouring building a month ago; it seems that at every turn these people confound me, demolishing whatever I can build of sense. My fears are constantly assuaged by those I meet; that the illnesses are nothing serious, that the people of Loss are delicate, rare, and proudly so, and that it will pass and that death is not so serious, for them, especially children; they are prepared for the next life early in years. They seem right; only two or three have died, though I worry about the little girl's father. I try to get Friend to stay away from the young, but she communes with them like a mother owl, feeding them chocolate and joining their games with no invitation or even words passed between them. But, she seems well, and even though she barely speaks to me she seems content. I can breathe without numbers, again, I think. I had thought their parents were preoccupied, for it seemed that every child was filthy, their faces and necks black with what I thought was coal dust or soil, though there were too many, and in such a regular pattern for this to be case. I had then thought that they wore their hats too tight, or that there was some pixish game being played on the fool foreigner, but more and more of them appear with it, and they do not play games anymore; they cough, and gaze at the ground, drooling and dragging their feet, and their knuckles are dirty though they do not work. I must plot the viral implications of such a sickness; if pathogenic, exit plan twelve seems likely best; it avoids the graveyard, and can be adapted for daylight. I went to the Mayor's office to find out what had happened to my neighbours, the image of the father embossed in my head. After offering me a strong, bark-like jerky, he told me through violent chews that they had been moved down the valley for their own safety, and the safety of their immediate neighbours. His son, Book Burnt For Secrets, played with a papier-mache volcano that had been constructed for him on the floor. He is a fat, sweaty little boy, one for whom I have had a dislike ever since the incident with the dung-heap. The Mayor tugged at his clothing, and has now begun to sweat in symbiosis with his son, thick patches rubbing themselves into his crotch and neck. I finally summoned the courage to ask after the boy's mother, and he ejected me from his office with as much aplomb as he could muster. I was escorted to the square, where two men I had not seen before, heavily bearded and with flour dusting their flanks, stood by the Execution Venn, staring at some hidden spot in its ellipsis, sharing a cheroot. The sickness, despite the authority's insistence of its mild nature, is making the townsfolk uneasy, superstitious to the point of madness. The last few days I have begun to smell something that I have only smelt twice before, once at Belsen and once in Ur; the scent of cooking meat, toffee-sweet in a way that only one animal is when burnt, and I felt the tingling of my nostrils as my allergies to ash and hot air remembered themselves and kicked. I retreated to the apartment, my little knock-hole becoming more and more comforting with each passing day, and found the present I had given to Friend in two pieces, nestled in its wrapping at my door. I brought it inside. That was at around four o'clock; it is long past dark now, and I have not eaten all day. I will write for the evening, and watch for corpse fires. If they are burning bodies, I will know. They may not talk to me, these inbred, but they cannot hide the lights of their fires at night.</Text>

He did manage a few days in each week, though by Week 6 he was ill, as expected, and we have not heard from his mother. Hopefully the vertigo. Drunk At Christmas 10 o o x o o x x o x Drunk is a bully and a truant, and his attendance was erratic. Towards the end of term he came to school haggard and increasingly ill, and the Lead Augur had no choice but to send him home for fear of infection. We believed it was he who had stolen the desks. Cousin's Kiss 9 o O x O O O O O x Cousin missed several days in the middle of term, though fears were allayed as she is still with us, despite being missing last week because of a punctured liver. Hand In Trousers 10 O O O O O X X X X Hand came into school in Week 3 with ugly bruises around his head; this was before the Town Order had notified us of any danger. We kept him in for a few weeks, but had to quarantine him as soon as we knew. Joy At Violence 10 O x O O X X X X X There are rumours of domestic violence and god worship at her home; the reason for her absence could be disease or abuse. It is not for us to say. Squeamish In The Face Of Dry Hands Rubbing 10 O O x O x x O X X Squeamish seemed to overcome his blight, after he contracted it, the symptoms disappearing and he was sporadically allowed back into the classroom. We heard he had relapsed, and his death was quietly announced last week. Book Burnt For Secrets 9 O O X X X X X X X The Mayor removed his son at the first possible juncture; I can only hope for his safety. The efficacy of my teaching, and the well-being of the others, has obviously improved with his absence. Gagging On Wooden Spoon 11 O X X X X X X X x Gagging, and her parents, have not been seen in town for months. Their home was abandoned, and was demolished last week. The roads are all lined with torches. First Bath In Winter 10 O O X X X X X X x First Bath was one of the early victims; his desk was turned to the back of the class, by one of the other children.

Scatterbird Caught Alone 9 O X X X X X X X X Scatterbird and Spiders were best friends and neighbours, and so the call that he had passed on came as no surprise. I have now learnt that the desks were taken by him, over a period of weeks. I went to his cremation, and saw the nest; it stretched between his home and the window of the house next door, where they had already demolished a room. It had been Spiders', and in the remnants of the webbing I could see the two desks, interlocked.</Text>

            <Title>Entry 15 - Incineration Order</Title>
            <Text>Incineration Order (This official document has been stuck into the journal. Atop it is the same symbol that is found at the head of the Feasibility Report, as well as a large, red warning that reads: “DANGER! KEEP OUT OF REACH OF CHILDREN!”) The Loss Town Incineration Bureau Dated That Day That Shall Come Parents, Pollution And You: Infant Destruction Order No. 17 This is a PUBLIC DISPLAY ORDER relating to Civil Justice Order: INFANT DESTRUCTION AND DISPOSAL. Articles below, if applicable, are to be complied with at a date no later than MIDNIGHT ON THAT DAY THAT SHALL COME. Any failure to do so could result in judicial action or forcible removal of your offspring. ARTICLE 1 – SYMPTOMS OF INFECTION The infection appears first in the form of black rings around the forehead of the child; the child will not complain of discomfort, though the bands will look like patterned bruising; if the pattern resembles bird-flight or crossed blades seek professional advice immediately. The doctor's banishment has temporarily been lifted in light of the current emergency, and she may be booked for appointment at the Town Hall. The child may complain of visions on the theme of hiding, secrecy or the clandestine; deal with such complaints in a soothing, non-confrontational manner. The child must not be allowed to realise their plight, or become alarmed; this can elevate the spread of infection and cause the child distress. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD THE CHILD BE CAUSED DISTRESS. The Loss Town Incineration Bureau have released a range of confectionery designed to lower stress and suspicion in infants; they are available at Sinister And Dexter's for a nominal price. ARTICLE 2 – CONTINUATION OF SYMPTOMS Around two weeks after the illness is first detectable the bruising around the forehead will begin to disappear. The child will become withdrawn and feverish; contusions on the hands and pads of the fingers will develop, akin to blisters or sores. The child may also begin to sweat alarmingly, and also tremble when holding small tools or cutlery. The arms will begin to stiffen and your son or daughter will have difficulty rising. These symptoms are known to vary depending on the child and their temperament. Typically the child will begin nesting around this time, using: - blankets - cushions - binding agents such as glue or honey - their own bodily products such as mucus, nails and hair. A failure to nest does not preclude that convalescence has been a success. The proto-dwelling is usually first found in the back garden, toilet or mushroom cellar; the common characteristics of location appears to be low temperature and high humidity. It must not be destroyed or removed, as this could cause the child distress. The child may also begin to produce meaningless strings of nonsense-phrases, rendered either in ink, mud, food products or glyphs constructed from small stolen household objects. Early reports suggest that these phrases revolve around themes of breath, fire and the grave. In children below the normal age of literacy, it must be stressed that this is NOT A SIGNAL OF INTELLECTUAL ADVANCEMENT. Phase One of your Grief Procession should also have begun at this point. The surreptitious burning of the child's possessions and bedding must be initiated; three items a day is the recommended rate. Any more and the child will become suspicious. THIS IS TO BE AVOIDED. ARTICLE 3 – THE DESCENT TO DEATH The child will begin to extend their nesting radius, spending more time in its construction and maintenance; nests of over two storeys have been reported, and parents should not be overly alarmed. The child will begin to have trouble breathing; any use of oxygen masks is prohibited, as this serves only to prolong the child's suffering. By the third week of infection all of the child's possessions should be completely destroyed, though they will not be missed, as the child will begin to spend all their time in the vicinity of their nest. Breathing equipment purchased from the Town Hall should enter utilisation at this point for the rest of the family unit; the fumes that the child begins to exude are dangerous to adult respiration. Please be advised that equipment purchased elsewhere may be defective and could lead to soaring visions or paralysis. Under no circumstances should you embrace, or have any physical contact with, your child. Death occurs approximately two weeks after the point of maximum nest height, measured by the height of the child multiplied by the number of grandparents still living. Phase Three of Grief Procession (see separate Public Order Sheet) is to be initiated. Weeping and the tearing of clothes are encouraged, though prohibited in public. ARTICLE 4 – RITUALS AND PROCESSES RELATED TO YOUR DEAD CHILD The child body must be burned; it is advised that you lock the corpse in your cellar, outhouse or similarly isolated space for the following reasons: 1) In order to allow the rest of your family normal respiration without masks for some time. 2) To desiccate the cadaver for ease of ignition. 3) To allow you to come to terms with your bereavement. Before necrosis sets in, however, the body must be prepared for cremation. The rituals must be performed in this order; - Ritual Relating To The Release Of Starlings And The Lower Soul - The Spreading Of Bleach And The Placing Of Fungus In The Eyes - The Murder Of Siblings and Grandparents Depending on the size of your oven, and the number of bodies generated by the final ritual, one may be tempted to burn the bodies in one's home kiln. THIS IS PROHIBITED UNDER ALL CIRCUMSTANCES. The spread of foul air must be contained to the town square, and all bodies must be delivered at 9.30am, 12.30pm or 3pm (the Town Hall will provide carts and beasts for the transport of bodies). It is imperative that your respiratory masks are worn at all times. A final goodbye will be permitted within the designated Farewell Zonings, and then the body will be removed for final absolution. Within three days you will be notified of your scheduled visit from demolition crews to remove the child's bedroom from your home. Thank you for your attention and vigilance. Please read the above instructions carefully and prepare for the worst. The Mayor wishes to congratulate you all in advance for your protection of the town and its livelihood, and has stated that at the first sign of infection he will begin the ritual murder of his own children. Yours sincerely, (An odd signature, like a gnostic, ritualistic diagram). Bright Coin In River People’s Liaison To The Mayor</Text>

            <Title>Entry 16 - Almost Alone</Title>
            <Text>June 2nd (Written Directly In The Journal) (Just above this date are various runic calculations, eldritch marks and counts of the passage of time, as if the Eremite is having trouble keeping track of the date). You see, here, what the so-called “authorities” have sent as comfort to those families afflicted; so cold, so hurtful! There is barely anyone in the streets. I only see Friend dull-eyed, wandering from the work of her father to the bare shop-fronts, and from there back up to her keep in Building 4. We speak rarely, now. Her father is busy burying those who wish to be buried. The ash is a boring, constant snow. The townspeople seem to have an aversion to being interred, and only a few in every generation do so. The pyres have slipped into the streets, the church's eaves, the square, and onto the river in long lines of pontoons that blunder peacefully, like great smoking palanquins holding vacationing royalty, downstream. I still do not know where they all go; perhaps all the way to the sea. There seems to be no scriptural aspect to any of these proceedings, only personal opinion and taste. The dead are the dead. I attended the funeral of Spider's Nest in Barn, yesterday; he had been ill for weeks, though not with the plague. I never knew how old he was, and no-one would tell me, though his sexual inexperience and penchant for inventive swearing gave him the air of a much younger man. He had spoken to me a few days before he died, not bedridden but sat at his desk whistling through his teeth and scooping earwax out of himself with a specialised widget, and told me that he was glad he had lived to see the death of his people. I told him that it was not the death of all of them, that only a few children had succumbed, and he had nodded his head grimly. The old bat's funeral was short, as Mr. Lights had to continue his duties. The Long Men Tails placed on his grave, traditionally by the women of the town, were quickly removed and held grimly by the council-appointed mourners for the next funeral, the attendees of which stood sweating in their heavy robes. They then demolished the library. The Mayor merely watched for some time, before smiling and commenting on the excellent and invigorating sunshine they had been experiencing. After this outburst he had crawled, a defeated monoped, back into his halls. Three days ago I had maintained my post in my apartment for nearly a week solid; I was becoming ornamental, calcified, terrified to leave the room. The people were of a weird disposition, even more so than usual, and what had begun as a fascination with their idiosyncrasies became like looking into a very deep ocean trench, where light does not reach and fish hurriedly grow as many eyes and mouth and fins as possible, and eat each other in a horridly rapid fashion as if the film that they are projected from had been sped up. There is a strangeness and a brutality in their day-to-day business, the burning of their children, the murder of their elderly, their keening as if to some Stygian god, though the gods are the last thing that they would keen for. They scream to themselves, and having seen the wailing for the Gentiles at Jerusalem, the cutting of labia for Ouroboros in Chad and the pissing on trees and scattering of seeds in Canada. A people with no religion, with no-one to turn to, is a terrifying thing indeed. I had not removed my mask in that time at all; the advent of the disease had made me cautious, and the recycled air and carbon were starting to drip and solidify into stalactites at the end of my trunk. On that day, ready to bond with the floor and become some sort of mineral, I heard a knock at my door. I bounded to it, expecting it to be Friend come to apologise for her indiscretion, or someone bringing food. However, I was neither wrong nor correct. It was a tall, shapely girl of twenty years or so with a crop of white hair that ranked around her face like the battle helmet of some albino Irishman. I held the door to a crack, and she waited expectantly for a greeting. I eventually placed her; the hurried footsteps across the hot square in the March heat, the spluttered title of “Long Man”, the birthday that had been celebrated in her absence a month before, her age a supposedly ridiculous number. Dark words directed up into the woods after her. She was the town witchdoctor, a beast-shaman who lived high in the trees and spoke to the spiders and deer, who whispered to Whisper in a great holler in the midst of night, one whom no-one looked at directly, or spoke of without ending the conversation. She was treated with special dismissal even in this patriarchy where the women were seen as explosive castratos, problem-men who only existed to eject milk in gleaming fountains. She wore a formal yet summery dress of blue, covered in curling vines, and, seeing my recognition, gave me a strange curtsy, one that involved lifting her dress almost over her head, revealing the whale-white scars and infected tattoos high up on her legs. I remember, then that she spoke to me in the tone of a stern father, and asked how I was. My reply was inconsequential; before I could finish she produced from behind her back a tin of chicken paste, with the local seal of wax. She handed it to me, and in my excitement and hunger I cut my fingers on its edges. I forgot that I was wearing my mask, and began to push the mess through the filter in my haste. I asked her to leave while I ate, and when she refused I was too hungry to argue. Off it came, and the second woman in ten years saw the colour of my eyes. When I had finished, she asked me, slowly and quietly, if I would come with her. I had come to a reckoning with the walls and floor of my abode, a reckoning of comfort, and I was scared to leave the building. However, she repeated her request, and it became, quite suddenly, the most reasonable and basic request that had ever been asked of me. I gathered my camera and recording box, tying my pack shin-ways to keep it tight, and followed her brisk pace down the stairs to the dark canals below. I remember little of the journey to her hut; night was welling up from the valley floor, and there were fires everywhere and the tang of barbecue. Humped, crying shapes were pushing other shapes into the canals, and as we reached the Main Street long lines of people roamed it, peering into shops, coughing and nervous. No-one looked at her, or me. Perhaps it was that without my mask I was merely another rube, another Mongoloid ferreting through the black store-rooms and alleyways. I remember the dark forms, that seemed to me to be the bobbing heads of some demon, but were in fact the nests of children, filled with their own faecal scratchings and the agony of their illness. They hang in the trees like the dreaming heads of gibbons, and shivered as their occupants turned in their last night’s sleep. The day before I had recorded Recording ::829NKE// removed for processing. the cries of spectators as one boy, delirious and bleating, had fallen from his nest, shattering on the pavement before his parents. There are more machines, down by the river, but now I do not even bother to search for them. We left the Old Town behind, and the confectioners, and the beetroot fields that were past season and wilting and black, full of vegetable liquid and sluice from the river. Her home, I surmised, was set far away from the town, and indeed I had seen many workers thumb some sigil in the direction of these hills. I asked her if she believed she had any magic powers. She said that she did not. I asked her her name. She told me, simply, turning and illuminated by the pyres in the distance, that her name was Cunt. I was taken aback by such a creature uttering such a phrase, and asked her who had given her this name. She frowned and told me simply that her mother had, and this was enough, and she turned back and walked further into the woods. We came, after half an hour or so of hard hiking, to a barrier of sorts. We were in the midst of an ironwood forest, that rose onto the side of the mountain. I realised that we were heading north, towards that wrong-footed summit where the Mayor thought the sun rose. On the ground was a silvery line, wet like a slug's trail, that extended in a large curve on both sides into the woods. I asked her what it was, and she told me that it was as far as the townspeople could come. It was human spittle, forming a neat band. The people came all the way out her to curse at the borders of her home. They called her the foulest word my tongue could muster. They hated her. I watched her skip over it like a rope. The path continued for another five minutes or so, winding up to an utterly hermetic position in a crag of granite amongst the crowns of sturdy evergreens rotting into death and mist. Her hut was here, unremarkable; raised on stilts like those of the farmers, thatched and circular, with five storeys. She led me inside. I had expected more, if I am honest. It was a farmer's hut. There was not one Long Men Tail; she said that she had no use for them. She brewed beet tea in an urn, and I saw the smoke meander to the upper floors through a hole in the ceiling. She took off her shoes and I saw her feet were hard and gnarled like those of Victorian furniture. For such an animal to end in these extremities shocked me. She said that she walked a lot. And then we spoke. We did little more, for a long time. She showed me her wand, the only Long Man Tails in the house hanging from it, given to her by the Town Hall or divine providence, she would not specify. I realised that I had seen her on the day of the Inauguration, in a shawl and carrying the great metallic albatross like it was truly precious, sitting behind the Mayor, not speaking, not watched. She told me that on certain ritual evenings she had to sleep with the Mayor; she knew that he did not enjoy it, and that he would force a smile for the crowds waiting beneath his window. She merely grinned, and said that he liked her more than he would admit. I set up my recording equipment, after a time, to preserve it. She was brutally frank. I asked to take her photograph, and she agreed, providing that I concealed her face on the negative. I promised her I would do this. I was compelled to keep such a small promise. She was different from any woman I had met. After an hour or so, she suddenly rose and asked me to leave. She seemed to be listening for something, or someone, out inside the night. She walked me back down the mountain to where the townspeople came no further, and bade me goodbye. I saw her phantasmal head bobbing like a Nippon lantern back through the trees, but I turned and hurried back through the town, the sounds of wailing low like Fokkerwulfs jettisoning their burning brains over my house. The fires smouldered, ready to be rekindled in the morning. I went straight to sleep, and spent the next day reading. I have heard people say that the Mayor is sick, though no-one will dare enter this quarters to check him for the black soot. Friend cannot possibly mourn the loss of her step-father; she always told me that she hated him, that he made her father spiteful. We had both especially hated his son. A few days ago I sat by my windows watching amantinas of ash drift away up the valley, when a small belch of flame licked itself and vanished into the clean airlock of the atmosphere. The sparks had hit a tyre of fat curling and heaving itself into the sky, and I knew then that I had seen the last flight of that hateful little pig. I wish she had been with me so that we could have both laughed behind our hands, as I had taught her; I pitied the Mayor, but after it all, I did not mourn the boy. Perhaps it would not have been wise, perhaps the shit had been her cousin, or her half-brother; the ethnic nepotism that these people practice means that I can never tell who is related to whom. I have already begun planning my exit from the valley; I made careful note of the route that the rube from the woods brought me when I came here, and I have streamlined my pack so that I may run, if necessary. The town was hostile to me from the beginning, and though I have learnt much since coming here, this illness has shut the place up like a bivalve. There is nothing left. I will speak to Friend tomorrow about coming with me; I can take her to Minerva’s; they can give her books, wash her, soothe her, bring her into the day slowly. Sigurd will bring her papers. They will look after her, and I can have her tell me more, to fill in the gaps of this place. She has often spoken about leaving. And I should like to see her legs in a real dress, running over concrete instead of dirt. I can hear the town crier. He is howling. June 3rd The town seems quiet today – there are no fires, and the few people I have seen have greeted me cautiously as they pluck provisions from the supermarket; there is a huge pile of coins on the empty counter, embellished with reverence by every potential looter. This strikes me as pathetic, though I believe that I am just tired. I saw two men pull a huge, grey hose from the side of a cylindrical structure and course steaming water over the cobbles of the main square. I could smell vinegar, over everything. One man carried all of the nude photographs in a haversack. I have replaced my mask out of habit - the skin on my face is foetus-fragile. I went down the River Walk to try and escape the grain in the air. It is an old street, bordered by high, dry-stone walls and climbing ivy, snow-blossom and petunias, peppered with gateways leading to mansions and the observatories of the rich. Before I reached the river I found a fresco, peppered with mould, painted onto one of the walls – it showed a fearsome man holding some sort of spear, wearing a crown (though it is not black) and standing astride a mountain. The accompanying legend was written in the Tachygraph, and I attempted to translate it; it seems I would have no more teaching, now. My attempt is below. As I tread through snow The holes my feet make behind me Look like the nostrils of my enemies Upturned and skywards Their heads rolling in the fields.</Text>

            <Text>He finally died last night. Mr. Light has finally stopped pretending that he has any chance of living, and died. I helped Friend baste him with tar last night, leaving him to rest like a Christmas turkey in the common chambers, and set him alight this morning, floating him down the river on a makeshift raft that I pulled together from abandoned street worker's poles and the nets of fishermen..The flames burped as they touched the tar, and when he had dissolved utterly his burning fat turned into a thick, musky soup that drifted downstream like some malignant, sentient carpet mould. His clothes fell away before this, as if at some preordained signal, and I saw that his member was tiny, wrinkling in the fire like a dead leaf. I pulled Friend's head away, but she almost seemed bored, and turned back to the apartment district, dragging the small trolley of provisions we had collected. She may be crying, but as her face is always wet now I cannot tell. As I write this we are in my quarters; Friend refuses to go back to her own. It is nice, in a way, to have her to stay, finally. The night is very dark with no fires to light it, and the sweet smell of the pines now meld with the mealy crust on the water. The once-leaping torrent is an orange waste, full of mud, poison and the dead. The town is quiet. We are the only two left. I thought a few days ago that I saw others, stripping a tree of half-cored fruit, a precision set of dentures that moved as one, but it could have been raccoons, or one of the impossible things that live here, tempted down from the mountains. I feel no real urge to write; we spend our evening throwing the last scions of the mushroom caverns onto the fire, eating them browned and tart from the wood and peppered with eggs the white insects laid a few weeks before. The black ones lie poisonous on the griddle. This whole town seems like a giant trap, now that I have no one to show me where to tread. I wish there was more to read. I sometimes want to dash my brains out against the floor, but then I sit instead. Friend will not speak. The advice about the poisonous eggs in our meals was one of the last things she said to me out loud. I may as well be alone, as she does not seem to care what I write, or the fact I am writing; I head into the town to bring her food that she heats over the stove, staring into the cracked tiles painted with idyllic valley scenes on the wall behind it. She lets me kiss her, but with no enthusiasm or hint of wanting me, and when I tried to reach up her skirt this morning she climbed back into the bed we cannot both fit into, even with the closeness of lovers, and my hand slipped down as her legs moved. I want to help her. She does not display any symptoms of disease yet, but her eyes are baggy and her cheeks are sunken, rickets and kwashiokor settling in. She is still very pretty, however; not beautiful, but there is a pinch of what she once was. I will find her some chocolate. My trips into town for food have been augmented with research; with the people gone, animals have begun to materialise in the town; Genial Wort, the stubby deer they breed here, scatterbird splitting in great squadrons that multiply as I approach cadavers. One thing I must note is that I see more and more of the pageant weevils, at first massing only by the river and the docks, but as the days go on they have reached Main Street, and their hive must be close by. Many of them have all their legs intact. Such a thing helps me, to see that at least something is benefiting from this mess. I still avoid them, though, making sure that I can see the newborns as I walk, brown on the road, unpainted, seeming to guide their less-fortunate parents. The Mayor's death has left the Town Hall open like a grieving thing; rot and silverfish jam themselves into its layers. I realise that underneath this steely façade the structure is just cheap wood, varnished and warped by years of supporting the weight of the outside. The doors that opened for me only at the behest of officials now hang like a dislocated mouth, and an acacia has leapt forward like a tongue of Bunsen flame, extending into the sunlight. Ash is arrayed there in a moribund beach, and, listening for the tell-tale scratchings of weevils, I risked a final trip inside to search for artefacts. I remember my routes very well; I did not want to get lost. The statues and busts were mostly intact, but many of the rooms were locked, or seemed to have disappeared. I wish to salvage something from what I have done, but I fear that much of this town will perish with its inhabitants. Some new, thuggish myths will shoulder their way into history, and squat over the town, letting it die and thinking of the lies they can tell now that everyone is dead. The bust will be reworked into new smoothness, and no-one will know a human ever signed a document or tickled a woman's back in this horrid place. I found the missing rooms today. They are in the south, past the river, stacked atop on another, the furniture broken or fallen in their interiors. Some of them are already becoming overgrown, and I heard a strange whirring from within a long kitchen, as if some machine had started up afresh. The Mayor's office was unlocked, the carpet grown with spidery blue algae that swayed in the movement of my entry. I would have picked it, but I saw that Book Burnt For Secret's papier-mache volcano was rooted in the centre of the room, growing fungus and fur, infested with lice, termites and arachnids. I remembered that he had used bleach in it, and burnt his hand, and so turned to the desk and the bookshelves, the one-way window that looked out across the western forests. Only one of the drawers was unlocked, and there was the official key to the town, a bright gold still, and reflecting off the bloated ceiling. It was the very same one I had touched on the day of my entry into the town, and seemed to be the only thing not wearing a musty coat of rot. Without thinking I added it to my growing pack, and as it got dark I brought it back for Friend. She regarded it without speaking, and I had her pose with it for the camera, beseeching her and offering her strips of ham and sweets. The heiress of Loss, with her birthright. The town now belongs to her. She is the only one left. I realised in that moment that I have no idea how old she is. I have asked her but she just sleeps. I am thinking now. The ash is starting to settle in this capsuled mountain air, but there are still black, foul-smelling spores, like human hair, that settle on everything that does not move. Every morning more and more of it is gathering in drifts six or seven feet deep. Yesterday I went to the edge of the K!K!K! Pitch, to leave a token for Discovering Leprosy, and found that a wall of edelweiss and chrysanthemum had exploded into growth along its border, run through with briars, marjoram and all kinds of herbs. The ash is feeding the soil, and it all seems futile, really, our little hollow, cooking and keeping it tidy, when the place is beginning to overgrow and decay. It seems that the secrets of the K!K!K! Pitch will die with the town; I can find no way into the pitch, and I keep seeing the dead man float up the river, and I am frightened, very frightened. The castle, or folly, sits at the point that the river enters the pitch – but the gluey consistency of the water keeps me from it, and I must look, trying to guess if those stones were quarried hundreds of years ago, or if they are merely plaster, painted and to be viewed from afar. An hour has passed, and Friend has gone to sleep with a bad cough. It seems stupid, now. I have taken off my mask as any benefit it may bestow seems wasted; she has seen my face once before, on that night we decided it would be right to kiss, and she said that I had the most peculiar mouth, and the most brilliant eyes. I have never destroyed a people before. My breath and its contents does not matter. It is startling how quickly the pathogen can enter the atmosphere after I take it off; it is a hard thing to wear all day, every day, and you learn to crave your own company so that you may remove it. I had only taken it off for a moment to kiss her. And yet, how was she not dead? Surely she should have died first, breathing it in? Maybe they are all wrong. Maybe I don't carry this damned disease. But it does not matter, now. There was no point counting all those breaths, all those cubed units of air, all that dividing and multiplying. It did its job. Bravo, (Huge amount of crossing out here) I thought I saw a light to the north, a few moments ago; as if the sun was hitting the mountain as depicted on the town's seal. In all my time here I have never bothered to check if the sun really does rise in the north as they say. I will check tomorrow. It is all I can do, really. But there is so much, and I am a small man; I cannot carry it. There is so much I do not understand, that these stupid, secretive folk would not give me. Tomorrow I will find medicine for her, something to make her feel better, and try to break into the K!K!K! Field. I have things to pick up. Things to catalogue. There is still much to do here. I sign off here, and commend myself to you. I hope I have been of use, given the circumstances. I may see you again. I will take her to Minerva's. Look for us there. To Do Pick up milk (not rancid in Hotel safe) Pick up medicine Polish relief on Apartment 34's East Wall Visit Cunt's hut. Pick up customer ledger from the art cave. Burn the last of the bodies Bake pie for Friend. Raspberry? Onion? See what has rotted. Last Page Of The Journal There is a scrap of paper here - it is burnt, ripped and smeared with dirt, almost beyond recognizance. At the head of the page is a short passage in the Tachygraph, and the words “Order Of Service” in flowered type. This accompanied by a coloured print of a scatterbird - it emerges from behind a tree, smaller birds splitting from it as it rises. Below, in the Eremite’s hand, are the words: MOVE, MY LOVE, BENEATH WITH THE ORBIT OF BONES, OF BUGS STILL YOUR VENGEFUL FEET FROM KICKING THROUGH TO MY TRAITOR LUNGS</Text>

            <Title>Office Content Introduction</Title>
            <Text>OFFICE CONTENT Unified Features THE GAME This side of the content is the ludographical, text-based side of the project, where players use the Miasma Content to work their way through the world of the Widsith Institute, solving puzzles and making text-based choices, in a free-to-play environment based on Failbetter Games’ Storynexus platform. ACCESS CODES AND WAYS IN Signing up should be as smooth as possible. Readers can come across Miasma Content, the log-in page itself, or have the page shared with them by friends. When they sign up, they are told that “we do not care about who you are” - that their sign-up allows them to take on another personality, if they so wish. The access codes either change something within their existing account or provide them a bonus when they begin playing. To conclude, there should be as many ways into the game as possible; this does not, however, mean that those ways need to be well signposted. The idea of the two sides of the experience is to disseminate each other; the Office Content provides a spine for the Miasma Content to hang off, and a reason to access it and seek it out, and the Miasma Content provides the push to the Office Content as a way of collating it and framing the experience. The web is random-access, even more so than books, and this should be taken advantage of. As a reference piece (referential, I suppose, to itself) this approach to the Institute is ideal. RANGE OF PLAYERS We are expecting a large proportion of our players to be ARG enthusiasts or Storynexus converts. However, given Random House’s reach we should not underestimate the influx of non-gamers and readers of traditional literature with a new tablet. We should make cultural, literary and technological compatibility a priority, to allow as many people to play Black Crown as possible. I want a large part of this experience to be learning; from the gamer’s perspective, this is of interesting subjects; from the non-gamer’s perspective, this is gaming techniques and the possibilities of hypertext literature. Intuition should be rewarded, as this combined with learning drives comprehension and thus the thirst for more content. A balance must be struck between counter-intuitiveness and a guiding hand. STORYLETS These are branching stories represented by pieces of text with outcomes that affect different qualities. I have agreed with Alexis that these will be a little more verbose than those found in Fallen London, though the idea is that they are a counterpoint to the longer-form Miasma Content. Their form is generally that of a memo, or action to be taken, and then the corresponding actions. They may relate to the Miasma Content, or just to the character’s life within the Institute. Strong and weak paths do occasionally exist, but most often they are merely different. Emotions should not be qualified; rather, the storylets describe emotions that you could feel that would in turn affect your decision-making. The best way is a hopscotch approach, or a redoubt approach - doublings-back, returning to past events, promotes contemplation, lowers costs, and gives a sense of body to the weight of the experience. Diverging paths create this in an even greater variety, allowing distractions and even encouraging them as part of the story process. MONETISATION Monetisation will come from separate different mediums; through the unlocking of time-based storylets, the direct purchase of storylets, vanity items, and perhaps, in the future, a Premium account that relates to our wider community initiative. MIASMA CONTENT CONNECTIONS I think that organisation of the Miasma Content is something that casual users, or curious “passers-by”, will struggle with; other than listing URLs, there is no way to show them in any sort of order. It is imperative, therefore, that signing up for an Office Content account allows one to collate the pieces of Miasma Content they have already found, and re-order them in any way they see fit. This could be achieved with an API built into the engine, and recognising when a website has been visited. META-CONNECTIONS As this is a hypertext narrative, at its heart, there are several real-world websites that may benefit from being altered to reflect a previous presence of this narrative, sites such as Wikipedia and IMDB. Alexis has also found an API that allows documents to be sent to an address, though this is far in the future in terms of our deployment, if we were to investigate it. The Office Content, to conclude, exists within the wider ecosystem of the web, and its connections to it should reflect this. LENGTH The length must be fairly tight to begin with, containing the main story and some depth, with open threads for later content (especially that in Phase 3). We are looking at an average playtime of 2 months (for someone who is not a speedrunner, but who plays it more than once a week, perhaps even a little every day). This equates to around 60 distinct storylets, or about 4000 words of content. INVENTORY The player will have an inventory, which will provide a linchpin for those coming from old-school adventure games to this experience. It will be easy to navigate and use, and will not bear too heavily on the experience; it is really there to give objects a home, and give some physicality to the desk-based gameplay. SHARING Sharing is vital to something like this, but we must be careful, and find a way that does not plaster the page with immersion-breaking buttons and sigils. Players can connect their Facebook profiles to their account, for example, but social networking is more there for dissemination, messaging in-game and community support. Sites such as Reddit and Delicious are built for this sort of fragmental categorising, and should be supported from the outset. Though this may complicate things (see ‘Asynchronous Multiplayer, below) players could trade diseases secretly, and perhaps infect their friends; they may add, but never take away. This would be an essentially benevolent action, in the logic of the Institute. ASYNCHRONOUS MULTIPLAYER A player’s progress through the world of both the Miasma Content and Office Content is singleplayer - they are not interacting with other players in a real-time sense that we know as multiplayer. However, by encouraging players to communicate and bond outside the game, we can simulate a sort of multiplayer. This relates to the tradition of puzzle notebooks and Myst journals in the past - players will document their progress, document their findings, share them with others, and talk about possible solutions. By annotating the Miasma Content, inviting their friends, speaking about choices in Office Content, and roleplaying in forums outside the game, knowledge, learning and community are disseminated widely, and the game is played collaboratively, without the need to keep players actively playing to recruit and support new players in the future. A pertinent comparison might be a Multi-User Dungeon, a place where many people explore the same space but communicate asynchronously. The sense of presence, of an inhabited world, and not communication, is key here. REWARDS AND INCENTIVES Rewards are vital to driving the ergodic nature of the text; it is “work” to move through and sort the narrative, and so rewards and incentives can be an aid to driving this forward. In addition to the qualities, items and diseases that one recieves from playing the game, there may be other rewards for being the first to do something, or within the first hundred or thousand. Those who are not doing well could be chosen at random to do something spectacular, or play some part in the narrative; they are not special at the start, being part of this Institute, but they have powerful abilities. There is a desire everywhere to rise above the mass and prove oneself important; if someone has a History degree, or is good at cryptography, they may find their own reward in the wider community. This is the Imgeii Effect. The players, in a way, come to mirror the townspeople in their pursuit of reward and meaning within a community. Players may even have the chance to impress themselves upon the world, perhaps influencing storylets and other players, becoming like bards for what we have created. Sometimes, given the opaqueness of the world, players will not know which rewards they will recieve, but they will always recieve something, they will always make a “dent”; a positive/negative impact that still allows progression. Some of the time this will be HIMBL - Hierarchical, Immediately Meaningful Bling, other times a negative disease, sometimes a piece of text or a quality increase. Depth is relative to storylet, and a player can often go deeper. We need to make sure that we build in this depth. Diseases are one of the key badges of progression, other than qualities and the inventory. It instantly shows one’s rank within the Institute, and serves as an achievement system also. NO GRINDING Grinding storylets for high numbers of qualities was a feature of Fallen London, and we are moving away from this. There does need to be repetition of content, but there is a way to do it that does not involve grinding. It is an interruption of the journey. Thankfully, we have a storied reason to repeat content, but that does not indemnify us against making it interesting. The TQEs are a way to combat this. DRM DRM is not desirable, and we should avoid it; in fact, the sharing element of this work speaks against it. We should combat the text being copied wholesale, but apart from this, the ecosystem keeps everything in place. CHOICE AND CONSEQUENCE Choice is central to the concept of storylets. One makes a choice, feels complicity, and experiences the conserquence. Choices can be emotional and moral, or mechanical and strategic. They may be necessary or superfluous, binary or complex, illusory, secretive or clear. Complicity is key; there must be a visceral reaction to the choice, a sense of agency and effect. The consequence can be immediate, delayed, or both.</Text>

            <Text>ARTWORK Unified Features A WIDE VARIETY The breadth of artwork in this piece is quite large, from the traditional to the outsider, from the symbolic to the informative - graphs, paintings, sketches, drawings, diagrams, woodcuts, maps, photographs and more. This list will grow when and if the project is successful. They will be crafted (in the fiction) by many different hands, at a number of different times. This variety must be evident. VERNACULAR DETAIL Incidental detail, and symbolism, even in the most mundane of pieces, is what will bring them to life. Readers will already be in the mode of analysis. As well as striking them with beauty, the pieces should add to the richness of the town and the characters, and lead them to new revelations. A NEW STYLE This is something that I need to work on, but the town needs a new style that works with its peculiarity. It will take tropes of classical art and subvert them, and superficially present a very alien view of human life. Elements such as holding animals (this time at arm’s length), spiral designs, titillation, pictures of the gods (in pathetic poses) EVIDENCE These pieces, like the writing and 3D models, are evidence, and should bear the marks of travel and handling - stains, blemishes, etc. These can even be part of the puzzle that they present.</Text>

            <Title>The Institute Introduction</Title>
            <Text>THE WIDSITH INSTITUTE

            “Iam Adveho Verum, Deus, Verum Adveho Iam”
            “You Are Unnoticed, And May Dig”

Who Are They?

- A personification of the Age of Discovery, they extend an imperialistic hegemony over narrative and secret places, for seemingly mysterious ends. 
- They are not a company: they are a charitable organisation, a trust that relies on donations. 
- They use diseases, both natural and manufactured, to conduct their work, motivate their workforce, and guide their office culture.
- They use field agents to collect mysterious places, and home agents to edit accounts in a huge web of accountability and falsehood.
- Their corporate structure is based around warring departments, and is as such fractured and individualistic. 
- It runs itself as a flat society, where everyone is equal in plague. 
- It relies on the culture of retexturing photos that exists today to perpetuate this within its own structure.

Their Mission

- The employees of the Institute perform an armchair function; they travel to these places in their mind, as examples of humanity, and change them as they see fit.
- They control infection when it goes wrong, and use to set things right, on occasion.  
- Their job can only be done by those who are infected, who see things in fevers and other such things. 
- To fulfil the expectations of the world in what “strange” must look like. 
- Their mission, and the way that life unfolds within it, has numerous parallels to the town, and comparisons to it. 
- “Culture Of Charity As Industry”

Style And Aesthetic

- The approach of artists to look at corporations in a sinister way, entirely or with a veil of corporate PR friendliness, has been tired out for some time now. Approaching the Institute as a charity certainly refreshes this trope, but more needs to be done to find the right balance. A key difference here is that the charity has limited interaction with its customers. It is selling pity and sympathy. Also, its interaction with those it is charitable towards is often hidden. 
- It has the signatures and input of the very famous, and is bound by an unassailable sense of rightfulness, that all charities possess. None can refute the morality at the centre of this, or is ashamed to, and so it persists.   
- It is a confused meritocracy, primarily absurd, full of Dadaist structures of control. It preserves a dichotomy between this and its flat structure (see above).
- It is a charity heavily related to the sea. 
- Its lexicon and argot are designed to be spoken by those 
- The pig is its sacred animal and mascot, because of its use in disease research. It may also be considered the cow, as the word vaccine comes from cow in latin, “vacca”. With its four stomachs it churns and ferments, and is the heart of all disease. 
- They actually have little respect for the artefacts themselves. 
- They employ heraldic terminology extensively, combining it with “symptoms” to create a parallel between the two in constructing a player’s honour.
- There are diseases for everything, a boutique system which serves them well. 
- Like in Wal-Mart, they are not allowed to “touch” visitors, ostensibly for legal reasons, when really it is because of disease. 
- What is a host’s “umber”?

Concepts

- The employees of the Institute wish to leave this plane, but the diseases which they prize so highly keep them grounded. 
- “One cannot die with a cough.”
- Is there anyone above them? Do their orders all come from other players.
- Flies are, obviously, highly revered, and used as databanks somehow between departments. 
- They believe that infection in one person, closely observed, is more interesting than observed at a social level. 
- The relief of pain as a desirable tool for compliance.
- They use smaller, colloquial names for disease.
- The Institute is already dead - the people within it fight to keep it alive. 
- The mystery of infinite data versus limited data. 

The Departments

- The departments exist to provide structure to a player’s advancement through the game, as well as competition and intrigue.
- Though the player’s can only join one department, they may pay for additional storylets to let them move to another department at other points in the story. 
- Rivalries can exist between departments. Players can help define the culture of each, with mottos, names, and rituals. 
- In diagrams, they are laid out like a specific chemical compound relating to disease. There is, however, always one missing. 

They are:

- The Eremites - The department with the most secrecy and most stringent entry requirements, these documenters, poets, artists and travellers count the Miasma Eremite, amongst many others, in their number. They are Clades, arising from a common ancestor. Some have married and intermingled, but they are a strict lineage, and there can only be four at any one time. 
- The Wormery - The wormery is responsible for incubating and developing diseases within the Institute itself. They work in the Four Stomachs.
- The Majuscule - the sediment levels etc. 

The Mission Of The Players

The players join as members of the research wing of the Institute, nominally at the behest of the higher-ups, as part of the wing’s expansion in the wake of digitising materials. Their department is driving this move online, and the other departments are angry at them for changing the ecosystem of the Institute. 

Idiosyncrasies

- Everything is three feet away from everything else at all times in the Institute. This is why the facility is so large. 
- It is difficult to get any work done because of all the groaning, coughing, and internalised misery.
- New recruits are given a fresh start - completely healed of all outside diseases, as all who are new to games do. They start to crenellate and accumulate as they “progress” and “ascend”. Is this a good thing, or is digital cleansing better?
- A cold is sent in a wave of season across the Trust, to trick the body into thinking it is in the world.
- Even in this company, there are brown-nosers, careerists and endless no-hopers.
- They owned the Ogden Land Institute - there is a later link to this in a storylet. 
- They provide all the different ways of vectoring disease to their staff - rotting food, gas, enemas etc. They attempt to ferment disease into something new. They thrive on insect waste and dead air, engage in medical cannibalism.
- What role do cleaners fulfill - “a broom moves the disease along”, but is this what they actually want? 
- Smallpox scabs tucked in an envelope in a book - this is how they transfer diseases. Everything is kept very analogue. Only the players use computers.
- They have a turbidity scale, relating to fluids.
- Some lorem ipsum on their website. 
- How does interaction occur if quarantine occurs? Can we have a quarantine function, that locks players out - THIS is why they cannot access materials? A very ineffective team. 
- The process for creating an Eremite is in fact very easy, but a gruesome mythology surrounds it. 
- There are periodic, huge donations given to the company. 
- Single players can be quarantined, but only official correspondence is disallowed - people can contact them in other ways. They are given information, and others can solicit it. 
- They have tools which match those of the original makers of the work. 

Related Individuals

- John Snow and William Farr - Miasma debaters.

As A Charity

- It does not actually have any outward-facing publicity. There are no celebrity drives, no campaigns - how does it raise funds?
- The culture of charity-as-industry is very prevalent here. 
- Pity as a culture is prevalent here. Pity against sufferers of disease and the preservation of knowledge. The two go hand in hand. 
- As nobody can engage with it, it actively promotes slacktivism. 
- Easy asks, easy actions - a crust of simple-minded activism. 
- The telling of lies, and half-truths. Expansionism, selective morality.
- They believe that people are forgetting about these issues.

            <Title>Considerations - The Eremite</Title>
            <Text>Inspirations From History

- The Scold’s Bride - a way to inhibit and punish those who transgressed society. Usually women, he usurps this role, as he does with every other.
- Executioner - a state-appointed official who executed criminals and others, in an anonymous fashion. A provost, headsman or hangman denotes the type used - would the Eremite be a coughsman? They were shunned by their neighbours, usually gypsies (at least for the Ottomans) or a Scharfrichter (keen judge) who was aided by a roaring “lion” (a shouting assistant), and tasked with rubbish clearance and brandings. 
- Plague Doctor - a grotesque, long-nosed creature. He uses his stick as a pen, to keep him separate. No touching, wax overcoats.
- John Snow and William Farr - debaters against and for miasma as the main transmitter of disease. 
- A wandering journeyman - learning his craft on the road. Compagnons, jack and knaves.
- Hermits - he has his own version of vegetarianism, no need to keep clean, ornamental hermits in Victorian gardens

Why Does One Wear A Mask?

- To hide disfigurement, either to protect other people or the sensibilities of the wearer. 
- To make it difficult to talk, or express oneself. 
- To preserve the features of one who has passed, as a death mask. The Eremite is preserving the features of others, all those who went before him, built up on top of each other. 
- To appease gods and demons.
- To cause terror in others.
- To modify or transform yourself.
- To hide one’s features.

Their illness does not incapacitate them, but allows them to travel. The fact that they are infectious is not often 

His Relationship With Disease

- It is part of him, and is infused in him. He cannot be cured.
- The miasma is tied to sea winds, and his desire for the sea can be attributed to it. He is allowed to take off his mask when he is in a boat, and perhaps infects the entirety of the world. 
- The Miasma, in Latin, is “nebula”, and should be tied to his love of stars.
- He is a little like the Pied Piper, and this comparison should necessarily be lost. 
- Coincidentally, because of his mop suit full of charcoal, he is scared of fire, and keeps away from it. 

His Relationship With Writing

- The “high-falutin’” language is a smokescreen - he is in fact a plain writer, and a liar.
- He is better at drawing animals.

His Relationship With Travelling

- He is called “The Stiff One” - he is so tightly bandaged as he is travelling so much. 
- He had a travelling companion?
- The Jellyfish Sea is mentioned.
- Ultima Thule and Ierne
- What did he eat as he travelled
- The sailors that he travelled with
- He pulls himself in - “the watermill”
- He references sailing around England
- Torres Strait Islands
- More about the hardships
- Travels with Irish monks
- He seeks the ports of light.
- Does the Eremite go to these places to ‘undiscover’ them? To drive everything false from the map? In this case, what is his relationship with maps and their ability to be remain false?

His Relationship With The Town

- In the end, he becomes a clown, a clumsy, tragic-funny figure. 
- He goes to fight monsters in this place. 
- He does not pay back any of the “gifts” he is given. He perceives slights everywhere. 
- He sees them in terms of energy. Low output/input, high potential.
- What is his blaison populaire for the people in the town?
- With what does he try to pay them?
- Does he order the cleanup of the town? Later on?
- The townspeople do treat religion as a disease, as it becomes a way to transfer bad practice. It is a horizontal transmission, like scared pigeons around a room, as they cause each other to fly away with the proselytism and remembrance of the past. The children pass this onto their parents, in a way, learning more of the rituals that supposedly keep them alienated. However, the Eremite also transmits both a literal and figurative disease in his malpractice of anthropology - they come to imitate him, his ideas and his actions. This needs to be clear. Some of their practices are very beautiful and, as he discovered to his shame and chagrin, have a  secret purpose; they become talismanic of his guilt as the story progresses.  Even their river is like a meme, in a way, bringing ideas to them and them mostly being discarded. There are huge nets in the river that capture refuse. They never use this rubbish, only sort it. 
- Their reactions to him need to be more varied. 
- The audience gets to see them, in a privileged position, in between his sanctioned recordings. 
- Does he smuggle her out in his suitcase - or an even smaller space. 

Equipment

- He has a cambium - a humour whose vapours are inhaled.
- The Gas Mask - a hugely inflated head, with two tubes, one for speech and one for breath. It extends down his throat. If the glass in the eyeholes shatters, the wearer is blinded or killed. There are sponges at the end of each tube. This is his shield, protecting and proclaiming. 
- The tent that he wears as a cloak. It has rents in it, and he views stars differently each time.
- He comes with a warning, like nuclear waste - I am poisonous, bury me in rock. In all languages, or in pictograms.

Do they have “children” in the structure of the Institute

The question of mankind's dilemma &quot;space&quot; is addressed in the nomenclature of the natural, more precisely, by means of positioning of the animal as partners, adversaries, anecdote, lecturer, screen, allegory, alternate vessel, Guardian, difference, the indifferent, necessity, Prisoner , deity, unthinkably cipher, and finally as the human. It follows, of course, a wide range of topics, from the emotional topography of fear and hope on self-made surfaces of denial to nudity, Pelzfetischismus, mechanized support - but also medieval bestiaries, zoos, the pet industry (not to mention visual image idylls, animal photography and funny creatures on youtube). Attentive glances fall on thinkers such as Walton Ford, Giorgio Agamben, Valentino Braitenberg, Temple Grandin and perhaps Cesar Milan. Whether it actually Danielewski manages to pull all this together into a whole coherent field remains to be unclear. must Especially since this whole thing of course, include topics such as synthetic intelligence, speculative fiction and the architecture of fate. But he will have by the end of the presentation may be made clear why - with a consideration of the human space-dilemma among animal aspect - the nature of necessity now come to an end. Perhaps it is all this but even as a pompous excuse to talk about his cat.

          - Women are more evident in the day-to-day of the town.
          - There needs to be violence, tortures, punishment - or does there?
          - The townspeople need to participate as well, but not too much.
          - The church needs to be replanned
          - Ruins  
          - Grotesque incidents, not just observations

trick him, to slip past his vigilance?

- Does the town crier have a connection to the outside world?

- What does happen after death?
- Heidegger - how does one become a being in the first place?
- What is being is a worthy question. 
- Decay and being are very closely linked.
- A philosophy of decay.
- World disclosure - the Eremite has little reference for these objects, and the situations they are used in are wrong. 
- It is almost as if the people of the town are playing as humans, just while he is there. 
- But they are not aliens - are they constructs? They are other, but not alien. 
- He needs to analyse the world, not as a background, but the town as an entity. 
- Reflective disclosure - he tries to restructure his world, but he is resistant to it. The world needs to shift, for a key to be turned and tumblers to fall, to understand where he is and what is needed to react appropriately to what he sees.


The Town

- How does the weather shape a people?
- How does geology form a landscape?
- Have they found a way to exist without trade?
- Who is the Apologist?

- How into astrology are they? And does this explain their preoccupation with the sky? 
- Can we see how it looked before he was there? What he changed?

- Why are they using disease?
- Did they cause the bubonic plague?
- What are the ambassadors called?
- Were they late to the web, and do they prefer to work within the physical realm?
- The ambassadors - how are they designed? What are their relationships to the sea?


- Is there a form of “white man’s burden”? Does it come from Kipling. 
- How does their office environment look?
- How do they isolate employees?
- How does their insurance policy work? Is it backwards, that if you don’t die from a disease you recieve a payout?
- Phantom teams and &quot;phantom efficiency&quot; - what are these people really doing?
- Where is his racism born from?

Sea Org - training levels represent creation myth, naval terminology, “we come back”
There are a LOT of parallels between Scientology and the townspeople - how can we divorce it from this notion?
Folly Town - to represent agricultural values.
Built for something to do.
Their ruins are follies.
Their states reflect some message about them.

            <Text>
- How can we make it clear that no everything is a ludographical puzzle, and that the writing, like with any novel or poem or narrative of any kind, contains its own mysteries that are not manipulable, but whose solution comes from one’s own mind, and has no haptic or visual feedback? Is this enough?

- Browser compatibility will perhaps be an issue, and we need to keep this in mind.

- The question of “difficulty” is a pertinent one. As a game there will of course be “solutions”, ways to use the content to further understanding and progression, and this is even more true when you attach the Miasma Content to the Office Content. But accessibility for something like this, with the additional audience that Random House will attract, is paramount. Obviously my writing is not “bestseller” material, but I think the world is intriguing. I think that it should be very easy, in a game sense, to access the full narrative, if not understand it - the puzzles should be non-vital but still important. 

- Is this idea of “editing” past content, and having version control, relying too heavily on the apparition of a “dedicated” fanbase. This may be too complex, and may seem, especially for paying customers, a little too heavy-handed. I think it is something not for Version 1, but perhaps a later event or expansion.

- Will the wiki be a problem to copyright and the story? I need to ask Alexis about this, given his experiences with Fallen London.

- Will the text be rich, or plain, with the writing? Will it be copyable? As it is already free, my initial thought is “yes”, but will it allow people to collate things outside the game? If so, we need to make the collation within the game far better.

- If everyone can unlock the content, the rewards within the game will be less remarkable for those who do do it. There will be no incentive to do it quickly. Time-based, or first-past-the-post-based puzzles could ensure that people want to do these things for themselves. 

- We must have a complete narrative at launch - it must make sense, and relate to a sensible portion of the game, but with lots of non-frustrating loose ends.

- How do we gain maximum mileage out of these items without returning to them too often, which reduces the efficacy and impact?

- People often “under-react” to events that occur in the plot - this should not happen, as it is incredibly annoying. They react inappropriately, as they are in a strange place and have a strange upbringing.

- Wikipedia: should we create pages for the Institute and other elements of our game?

- What should we call the inventory? - Stationery

- Should qualities be hidden or open, or a combination of the two. 

- How much should we integrate Facebook and Twitter

- Which social networks should we use?

- How do we make sharing more viable?

- How can we use repetition in the text in a decent way?

- How can Annotations work?

- Archetypes - easier in Fallen London, can the work here?

- Grind is so integral to this model. How can we minimise it? Do something five times, and interact with a piece of Miasma differently each time. 

- Why are they using disease?

- Who are the management?

- What is the hierarchy?

- Why are they collecting these narratives?

 - A box formation, rather than a list?

- Qualities come across as confused as to type. Which are items, which a progress markers, which are personality traits. How can we make them more distinct. 

- Is HTML5 the right direction. It is still in the process of standardisation, and is not so good at high levels of technical performance, but sidesteps the fractured mobile market and makes one’s work accessible. 

- Do we really need all the buttons?

- Most of the Insitute’s funds go into helping itself persist - why do so many people need to be

            <Text>- Come up with the logical puzzle system for the URLs.

- Discuss sharing buttons for these pages. Do we make it obvious that these are part of the larger world. Corporate logos (FB, Twitter) would be a disconnect from the fiction, but we do not want to make it hard for these things to be shared. Perhaps we could integrate these logos into the fiction, create fictive logos or descriptions for sharing that does not disconnect. Are there general symbols for these services.
