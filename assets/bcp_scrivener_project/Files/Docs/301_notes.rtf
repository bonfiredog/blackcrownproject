\pard\plain \ql\ltrch\loch {\f1\fs20\b0\i0\cf1 Apparently the obsession with height rather than width in the architecture of the town is to do with a concept known as \'00Ancient Lights\'00; I have heard it mentioned many times but have as yet to uncover its significance. I will attempt to find some literature on the subject and compose an essay when I find the time. }
