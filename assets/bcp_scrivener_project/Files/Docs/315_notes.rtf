\pard\plain \ri0\ql\ltrch\loch {\f1\fs20\b0\i0\cf1 It is hard for me not to see these as punctuation. The name of Loss, in the Tachygraph, appears to be \'00!?.\'00 if rendered as Latinate punctuation. This would seem to correspond to the phenomenon of loss itself; it is all there! The initial shock, the confusion and questioning, and finally the acceptance. Surely I am not the only one to see it? I must ask someone. Perhaps they mock me. They have done so before. }
