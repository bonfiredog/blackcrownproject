<p class="binderItem"><strong>The Institute</strong><br/>A nominally flat structure, but this does not truly exist. Rituals have a high degree of immobility. Why do we approach things in a certain way? And how to contrast the Institute and the town? Both decay and atrophy, so there must be a way to contrast them. “No right or wrong, just an interpretation of the rules”</p>

Do we want things hidden on their own? Do we need the access codes to point out where they might be useful. The repeatable tasks should be a smaller part, an optional grind Re...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Ideas For The Book</strong><br/>- The Eremite’s writings? A nicely produced anthropological document of some of the other places he has been? - I think, in comparison to the work, it has to be a little more sumptuous - straight text just won’t work. - A straight novel? From the perspective of the Eremite? I’m not sure this will be very interesting. You are buying into a world, and it undermines the perspectives of the main project. To have a third-person narration would undermine the world’s establishment, and first-person is ...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Valley Notes</strong><br/>A valley seals in decay. Wherever the eyes look, there is only rock, joined to the earth by its entirety. It disallows expansion, keeping a civilisation, drawn there by thirst and fear of the outside, hemmed in and unable to move in the way that is intended. Light is either trapped or does not penetrate, and nothing on the flat is illuminated for observation. It is only the slopes, and the promise of escape. Of course, this does make some people feel safe. Nothing comes to the valley, because of...</p>

General<br/>
<br/>
- The town is an allegory for several things, including:<br/>
1) itself;<br/>
2) my own philosophy;<br/>
3) The Institute (its diametric opposite).<br/>
- It is a community that has moved from an “elevated” state to a base state. Its absurdity contains a kind of honesty, in its adherence to literalist, dogmatic materialism.<br/>
- Unlike the reference in the Kindle piece, its placement is entirely accidental, if symbolic. It sits on the great river, “That Whose Name We Do Not Know”, which filters idea...</p>

There are degrees to which this is obvious to the readers, and at other times the truth is almost unattainable. The Witch Doctor - At the moment, she is too much like a Christ figure.

You see, here, what the so-called “authorities” have sent as comfort to those families afflicted; so cold, so hurtful! There is barely anyone in the streets. I only see Friend dull-eyed, wandering from the work of her father to the bare shop-fronts, and from there back up to her keep in B...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Entry 17 - Last Entry</strong><br/>He finally died last night. Mr. Light has finally stopped pretending that he has any chance of living, and died. I helped Friend baste him with tar last night, leaving him to rest like a Christmas turkey in the common chambers, and set him alight this morning, floating him down the river on a makeshift raft that I pulled together from abandoned street worker's poles and the nets of fishermen..The flames burped as they touched the tar, and when he had dissolved utterly his burning fat turned into...</p>

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Sea Charts & Maps</strong><br/>This is a collection of sea charts and maps owned by both the Eremite and the townsfolk, often stolen from one or the other, and embellished and changed to suit new discoveries. 2 Sea Charts K!K!K! Map Amateur Map Of The Water Flow In The Valley Features - There is a rip in one side of the map, and if players click this rip, it will flip over and reveal caverns on the other side, extending under the town.

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Sketch Of The Town's Coat of Arms</strong><br/>This is a sketch, in a detailed hand, of the town’s sigil, or coat of arms. Accompanying Note Opposite is a composite drawing that I completed over several days in my room and on the street; the town's crest seems to always be in the most distant or troublesome spot. Much was guesswork, though I believe that I received the elements correctly; the black crown I cannot guess at, though the key is a real object, kept by the Mayor, a symbolic fetish that I was given to hold on my first day here.

<p class="binderItem"><strong>The Escutcheon</strong><br/>This is a related piece to the Town’s Coat of Arms - it is a picture of Death of a Friend’s pubic hair.

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Fragment of Mural</strong><br/>This is a piece of mural that has been chipped from a wall; it is faded, and in bad condition.

<p class="binderItem"><strong>Tarot Harp</strong><br/>This is the instrument of the Eremite, rendered in a digital format. It is an “improvisational participation engine”, providing a way to play the music puzzles if one is not a musician. Description - It has the basic form of an autoharp, but it has been heavily modified. It is much larger, with ornate buttons and levers all over it. - It is battered, dirty, caulked in mud. - One panel is missing, exposing the inside of the body. Features - The harp is fully rotatable, and every angle may be seen...</p>

Description - It is mounted as if it were a stag’s head, on a wooden board in same shape as the town’s Escutcheon. - It has a hugely inflated cranial area, and seems to be supported internally by struts. - It is the colour of grey bone. - Two long hoses droop down from the nose, one of which ends in a calcified mess that looks like limescale at the bottom of a kettle. - The words “AHEM ATUM” have been written above the joins of each of the hoses.

The foreground is in shadow, as if something is behind the painter. Attached to it by string is a luggage label, which when clicked reads: Sir And Magus, My spawn sends her regards and apologises for the incident yesterday. She will be beaten, as per your request.

The community expands this out onto the web in a non-proprietary way, giving them a chance to push things to each other, as well. It creates a web instead of a pyramid ramp. <br/>
