I will be leaving this text here for those who come after me. I render it in the House Style, in which I would hope that all future clerks are accustomed
and fluent. It will be essential to your work, \\\\Clerk!////

As one of the most senior editors, it falls to myself to induct you into the \\_\Community Spirit Development/_//. Your commitment to your own loneliness 
is commendable, and as of yet we have had no or little accidental intimacy between editors. 

As a reward, and to combat any mental enclosure that may occur amongst the editors, we have provided the \_\\Community Spirit Development/_// as a pen of 
sufficient size and breadth as to accomodate all of you, in an [imagining] of space. Feel free to ask things of each other which you could not whisper,
[imagine] embracing and rolling and slipping into each other.

DO NOT ALLOW YOUR IMAGININGS TO IMPACT ON YOUR WORK

When I first write this, there are so few of us, and so few words read and considered. As we grow, I hope that this space continues in kind, and that any
unblemished editors that find their way here discover something that is not a relic, but is thick with a kind of life.

and you will be suitably rewarded for your attentions. 

I would also ask that you herald your arrival with a bray below. I cannot predict what sort of hierarchy will arise in my wake, but I would hope that it is 
kind, and responds to such rituals with decency.

Regarding Your Brayings

(Center Text) \\\\Clerk!////

In our many years as the herders of herds, we have come to hear the patterned calls of many animals in distress or tiredness as a sort of vast voice.
We realise that we wish to cure our own loneliness, and so we do not beat you with sticks, or shush you more than we have to, and allow that one gargantuan 
bellow to echo in our ears while we look out. The hills go on forever, we think. 

So, continue to bray. To our ears, you are discussing music, beautiful things, horrible things that you have felt and said and done, and it does not matter
that you are only hogs, and that those flat tongues only punctuate the air with

You are lucky, to have such dreamy herders, that they would allow such a racket to continue. No kicking, scratching, biting or self-abuse of any kind will be 
allowed. We will be quick with the crook if we see any. You are a herd, and you will act as one.
