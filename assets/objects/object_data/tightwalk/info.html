<b>Trottering Notes:</b> Near-originator. Very minor bacillus growth, but no water damage and small wood fibre rot mainly concentrated in the peripherals of the document (enzymes associated with expectoration). The document's condition can be attributed to snug shelter derived from the Great Work itself, and due to the continuity of the marginalia can be placed directly after the Bowspirit in inspiration and expiration. 

<p>This is an excellent example of Classical Islandscript, with the Eremite's undeniable flair and loneliness of thought. I have determined through glossal interaction that the medium is undiluted iron gall ink, confirming wild theories elsewhere. Despite the excellent preservation of the piece, we cannot source the front board and bindings of the Great Work that must have kept it safe. Original discovery made by <span class="red">\_\\</span>Clerk<span class="red">////</span> Antigone immediately prior to  <span class="red">___\</span>Alvaration 7<span class="red">/_/_</span>, and was removed from her pulverised calf and cleaned directly after the collapse.</p>
