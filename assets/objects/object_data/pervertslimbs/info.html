<b>Eremite:</b> <span class="red">____</span>The Miasma Eremite<span class="red">____</span><br/>
<b>Trottering Notes: </b></b>Pulp degradation abated, and mycelium liquor, in place of the usual gall ink, preserved in line with the Myiasis designation (see above); the flies are still mostly living, and horned, having produced a dermis of illegitimate larvae against the acidity of the soil; despite numerous tectonic events, saltwater intrusion and superior <span class="red">____</span>clerk<span class="red">____</span> disturbance, a successive walling has been established down the years; the air and mulch recycled to plaster over a new layer of defence. The soil is far more nutritious and appealing for the <i>sarcobalneum</i> than the Eremite's choice of parchment.</p>


<p>The Eremite's acceptance of a lack of menses ritual in Loss perhaps points to a lack of cultural currency about his person. Despite his civilisation, learning, wanderlust and deduction, he has not been permitted inside the normative sphere of Loss, and thus cannot accept that something may be hidden from him; instead, his ego sees nothing. </p>
<p>I would like all senior <span class="red">____</span>clerks<span class="red">____</span> to discuss this problem.</p>

<p>Unacceptable. The Eremite's position of sexual primacy with the female “Friend”, or “Death Of A Friend” (depending on honorific) points to a deep insinuation into the social fabric of Loss. Perhaps not every civilisation is as obsessed with failed potential as yours was.</p>

<p>\\__Clerk//// Wayle, I have your Work in front of me, and whilst I am not used to the formator the language, I can see that it has been noted that you are angry, and rather insignificant. I have a petition here from you for a specific promotion, “Deplorsy Minor”; it seems that you, also, are aware that you are not yet a senior <span class="red">____</span>clerk<span class="red">____</span>, and should not be engaging in these Excavations, let alone answering this question. Return the piece to the Marvel Ouse immediately.</p>

</br>
<p><span class="red">____</span>Clerk<span class="red">____</span>, I find it appalling that not one senior clerk can pluck up the courage, or stymie the shakes in their sleeves, to argue with you. The people of Loss are a tame, trusting people, this much can be seen, especially from Common Compression Name “The Tides In My Soup”. Given the Eremite's proven record of gaining (and maintaining) the trust of the uncivilised, it seems unlikely that they would keep something as mundane as a bleeding rite secret from him. They had, at this point, already given him so much.</p>

<p>I see you have received your promotion since we last corresponded. I shall have to come and find you, and see to your pain. In the meantime, I would refer your attention to the fact of the matter, the fact of the whole of the Eremite's time in Loss; he was never, ever permitted to spend the night inside the village walls. Despite his accumulated dunnage creating an ersatz settlement far bigger than Loss itself, they were at no point cowed, and only allowed him ingress before dark. I think that this piece demonstrates this better than most.</p>

<p>A submission to rubic suspicion. His insemination amongst the womenfolk was complete and total.</p>
</br></br>

</br>
<p>SHHH, <span class="red">\___</span>Clerk<span class="red">////.</span> Regard your forget-me-whole instead. Your new promotion is making you muddled. How could you have read so much of the Great Work as to be sure of that fact? I think we can establish who knows the Eremite better, out of you and I.</p>
