<b>Trottering Notes:</b> The increased value of this Excavation, due to the paucity of the Eremite's art  

surviving in any of his Works, has led <span class="red">__\_</span>Clerk<span class="red">____</span> Wayle to designate it as <span class="red">\\\\</span>cultworthy<span class="red">////.</span> 

Any <span class="red">\_\\</span>clerk<span class="red">/__/</span> who uncovers it afresh, and carries it aloft up into the light, is required to perform 

the minimum of digital manipulation, especially if they are particularly filthy. Oils, body-wines 

and other effluvia could permanently damage or erase the inkwork, and you would find yourself 

contributing to yet another Loss.<br/><br/>

<b>Notes</b>
<p>

An excellent, sparse example of Eremite diagrammaton, focussing on a perplexing idiosyncracy 

of the Lossian primigravida; the gradual disappearance, throughout the pregnancy, of not just the 

foetus from the mother's stomach but the uterus, womb, fallopian machinery, fat, muscle, skin, 

hair, blood and viscera that accompanies it. This 'Lantern' is referred to by the Eremite on one or 

two other occasions, and her progress from community slut to hollow warrior, her empty abdomen 

her concave shield and her pregnancy her heroine-quest, is fascinating in its detail. My own people 

never had such reverence for would-be mothers, but the Eremite, bizarrely, even seems moved by 

her plight. The death of the infant is unfortunate, but this <span class="red">_\\_</span>clerk<span class="red">____</span> feels that a certain amount 

of transcendant detachment, on the Eremite's part, would have been more appropriate. Anything, 

rather than this paean.
