You pull the seaweed from its flanks, but can find no ingress. It is sealed up beyond the pry of your trotters. You are tired by your efforts and lie there, waiting for night to fall. Nobody sees you sit by a statue, but as the sun falls a certain light starts to play around the case. The coral has found its way inside.
