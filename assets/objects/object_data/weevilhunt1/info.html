<b>Trottering Notes:</b> This is currently the best-preserved leaf of the Miasma Eremite's recovered documents. It shows very little sign of ageing or the decay associated with long travel and acidic soil. Current theories suggest that something protected the leaves, another fragment long since gone, or perhaps the Eremite retained some personal feeling for this particular piece of writing and kept it on his person rather than in his dunnage.
