<p>Notes</p>


<p>My travels through the bedrock of the Institute have garnered me to a little hollow, very close to the permafrost. I think my ears popped fifteen separate times, on my spiral downwards. I was able to crawl all the way in, and in that little crypt was what I thought was a door, taller than I was and studded with such beautiful designs, picked out in antediluvian copper. I felt like I was in the belly of the whale again, but this time I did not need to make my own slit. Please note, <span class="red">\\\\</span>clerks<span class="red">////</span>, that the little hollow, and any Excavations that they may proffer, are now the reserve of senior clerks, myself, only. We will not be sharing our Work.</p>
 
<p>I will allow those of you who have Excavated this far a little hint of what I enjoyed, however. I grasped the edges of the door, and pulled. It came away at a familiar enough angle, but beyond it there was not a room; only concertinaed earth. Pinioned to its rear surface was this Excavation, and several others, still berg-white, after all these years. It was then that I deduced, in all my learning, in how far I have burrowed since I joined this Institute, that this was the front cover of  the Eremite's great Work on Loss. I had not expected it to be so large. I can now imagine him so clearly, creaking the latch open every night to make a new entry, groaning as he was forced to bend, to scribe it at the very jamb of the page. </p>
 
<p>I did as my Work dictates; I tore this and the others from their housing, and scattered them through the tunnels I had made when I returned. I hope you Excavate them promptly; I am not sure how long their purity will remain, in the cannibal earth. </p>
 
<p>Chester-Stokes would have loved this! So proper, so fat with meaning, just like her. I almost, almost, almost, almost, almost, almost, almost, almost, almost, almost, almost, almost, almost miss her.</p>
