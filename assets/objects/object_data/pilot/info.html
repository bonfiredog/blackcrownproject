<b>Trottering Notes:</b> Numerous immersions consistent with salinity degradation. Oxidisation points to
elements of copper in the bindings. Pilot's Pamphlet designation \\|\JS-22490//|/ no longer in
production by Publicação Barbatana (ref. Assembleia da República Ato: Crueldade A Animais
Marítimos).

<p>Like most of the pre-Flight Miasma material, the text here is written in crude iron gall
ink, consistently dated with the Eremite's outward journey, especially the years spent gyring. The binding and thus the ordering of the pages has been lost along with the complete folio, but we are used to such by now. The illegibility of the script and wave of the line, unusual in the Miasma Eremite's oeuvre, is consistent with his delicate state of health and the turbulence associated with that particular stretch of water.<p>

<p>I am not entirely certain as to why these fragments have been arranged like this; Clerk Wayle must see some pattern that I do not. Especially considering the <span class="red">____</span>Recent Kloof Subsidence<span class="red">____</span>, I must commend his boldness, and apparently his rampant self-promotion. <p>
