<b>Condition:</b> <span class="red">\\\\</span>Material<span class="red">____:</span> Civilised kaolin, apparently unblemished. Sample taken reveals presence of petuntse and feldspar. No fading, diminishing, or degradation of any kind. Object remains as beautiful as when it was first fired. <br/>

<span class="red">\\\\</span>Clerk!<span class="red">////</span> The presence of bergamot and violet residue in the urn has already been noted - do not add it to your reports. <br/>

<p>
<span class="red">_\\_</span>Caution!<span class="red">_____</span> Tachypnea and parapnoia reported amongst clerks approaching, as well as three isolated cases of Hydriotaphia Syndrome. This is not a thing of honour. No great deeds were done here. I am marking this as unimportant and worthy of being forgotten: reinter without delay. Any further analysis should be conducted by seriation only.

<span class="red">__//</span>Clerk!<span class="red">\\__</span> I fail to see the need for such scaremongering. The object has not upset this <span class="red">____</span>clerk<span class="red">____</span> in the slightest, and I fail to see how much worse others could feel than they already do. Have you approached the Excavation yourself?

No, <span class="red">\____</span>Clerk!<span class="red">_____</span> I am not unexperienced in gravedigging. I have a vague recollection of other megadeleos that I have visited. There was one in my youth, I think; the Dee Huus, or something similar, on an island somewhere. I certainly have no desire to repeat the experience, and I trust my \\\\clerks//// well enough.

<p>
<span class="red">__//</span>Clerk!<span class="red">\\__,</span> you seem to have misplaced your House Style, in all your fear of this beautiful thing. I believe that you meant to address me as <span class="red">____</span>Clerk!<span class="red">____</span> I am fully pained, now. I am in agony, and you should address me as such. I’ve known pens to slip from steadier trotters, though, so I forgive the slight.

<span class="red">__\_</span>Later Addendum<span class="red">//__</span> I have revealed this object for study once again. I had quite forgotten about it in all the fuss; I envy the \\\\clerk//// to whom it is assigned. Every part of it is a flirt to the senses; the hipped sides of it, the glint of turquoise in any light, that beautiful colour. The Eremite refers to it, specifically, in his writings. I transcribe from my own Excavation: “And so I took tea with each of them in turn, sitting them at the Persuavant, fresh herbs under their noses, and I explained where I came from, and what I did, and I enacted the wind to make its music, to go, by my signal, W O O. I made the preparations, and more and more of them came.”
</p>
<p>
We believe and officially posit that these herbs were presented in the vase (not a dour urn as other clerks have marked it). I make an appeal to the <span class="red">\\\\</span>clerk<span class="red">////</span> who discovers it to touch its sides, imagine the hands that smoothed the boiling clay into place, giving the whole thing the impression of skin. Stop at the threshold, and imagine what it would be like to approach this, and find the Eremite next to it, waiting for you, beneath the trees, the wind fingering its own holes, the smell of hot nuts roasting somewhere within. This is not a warning. It is the most elegant of lures.
