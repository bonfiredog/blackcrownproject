<b>Trottering Notes:</b> Self-contained but fragmentary. No sign of malicious tampering. Extant text is
considered ad verbatim to original scribing. No sign of redrafting by Eremite; we may consider this ex muso.

<p>The abrupt cessation of the final word (which, we can assume, is not where the Eremite meant to
end his thoughts) appears to be externally motivated. Something, or somebody, grabbed his hand
as he was writing! It is a tectonodous feeling, to know that something was touching him, then, all that time ago, and to have the imprint of it break the air and touch us as well. </p>

<p>Just to note, <span class="red">\\\\</span>Clerk<span class="red">////</span>; I cannot find “tectonodous” in the Book of Pernick, and it is therefore not part of the House Style. Please rephrase yourself. </p>
