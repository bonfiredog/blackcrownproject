<b>C.C.N:</b> Jenny Garganta<br/>

<b>Eremite:</b> N/A (<span class="red">\\\\</span>Juvenilia<span class="red">////</span>)<br/>
<b>Trottering Notes:</b> Surprisingly excellent, considering overall journey. Marine palimpsest has been left intact to preserve quality of the wood. Most damage and blemishes are not due to neglect, but rather ambient battering and atmospheric abuse. All major organs intact, throat not crushed, and trunk has suffered no amputations. Schlagmetal shows minor tarnishing, but no Green-Of-Greece.

<p>Object has had a large amount of chyme removed, which had set in the main cavity upon initial unearthing.

<p>Very little to say about the piece. A portable tallgirl in the armario de cordero style, of middling workmanship, and a distinct lack of Venus about her; this is more of an ur-cow, a Wildorf replica, than anything else. Lacerations on the stomach appear to be self-inflicted, no doubt due to inevitable wood sag and hideous lack of care. She has absolutely no use to us whatsoever, especially as we cannot work out how to use her in a coastal setting.</p>

<p>Correction to the <span class="red">\\__</span>Condition<span class="red">__//</span> marker; this is ormolu, rather than schlagmetal work. Whoever has marked this as such, please note that you will not be allowed to see her again.</p>

<p><span class="red">\___</span>Clerk<span class="red">____ </span>Wayle, I appreciate your industry but not your tone. If you must know, it was me who marked it as Schlagmetal, as the work clearly shows an Iberian influence. This is clearly far older than you had thought. Please check your facts, and spend some time with the poor girl, before you reprimand any employee, especially your superior.</p>
