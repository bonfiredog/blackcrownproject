<p>A ludicrous conjecture, <span class="red">\||\</span>Clerk<span class="red">__//</span>Wayle, and a dangerous assumption also. What evidence do you have? Are there smears of shellac left behind? Crinkles from the Eremite hugging it to his breast?  What do you know about the him? Nothing. Apparently, nothing. </p>
