An Essay On Islandscript</b>
<p>

From his own discoveries in the peat-bed of the Institute, it is easy to deduce that one of the 

Eremite's greatest Works, <i>The Underweather Vanity</i>, containing an account of his time in Loss, was 

completed primarily in Islandscript, a typographical philosophy which encompasses not only the 

lettering, kerning, and the layout of any one page, but out to the ordering, binding and presentation 

of the entire Work, and then up further, into the loft of the writer's own sensibilities and lifestyle. 

It is a House Style lived in completely, built around a man of exacting tastes and perfectionist 

practice.
</p>
<p>

Consider the mislaid <i>incunabula</i>. From what we know of its construction, it is extremely large and

sturdy, build of solid mahogany planks, buoyant and resistant to rot, and in designation of size

being perhaps Octuple Elephant. From the Eremite's own references, I would estimate that when 

stood on end, it stands much higher than a <span class="red">\\\\</span>clerk<span class="red">////</span>, perhaps five feet six in some calculations,

and as wide across as a door. The pages within are, as any sufficiently sick <span class="red">\\_\</span>clerk<span class="red">//__</span> will know,

of varying qualities, weaves, pulps and compositions (owing to the Eremite's rather mongrel process

of procuring raw materials) and were bound inside the <i>incunabula</i> with brass pins hammered flush

into the wood.
</p>
<p>

Some pages span the entire height and width of the <i>inculabula</i>, and may more properly be called 

tapestries whereas others, such as the ones from which <span class="red">____</span>Clerk<span class="red">____</span> Chester-Stokes' transcript 

derives, are or were mere scraps, no wider across than a palm. I had the honour of studying this 

shard before it was destroyed, one of the many presented in <i>quarto</i>, a format of which, despite its 

rather bizarre appearance to this <span class="red">____</span>clerk<span class="red">____</span>, was apparently a favourite of both the author and 

the transcriber.
</p>
<p>

If one were to imagine these pages as islands on a sea of wood, some the size of continents, others 

of atolls and reefs, then this metaphor extends down into the text itself; the Eremite very often 

grouped his thoughts in tight enclaves of words, the last descender providing a ferry to the next, 

and then the next, and the next, and the next. And, remember, now, poppets, remember the pins?

Any <span class="red">\_\\</span>clerk<span class="red">//__</span> may bend their knees, if there are not too turgid, and root about their quarren; 

there, one is almost guaranteed to uncover the gleam of bronze. Consider the pin, raise it to your 

eye; see the mica of the sea, the kink the waves put in. Even in the glue of his thoughts, the Eremite

was considered marine. He considered all things islands, and lonely, to boot. This <span class="red">____</span>clerk<span class="red">____</span>

sympathises.
</p>
<p>

I leave the above as an introduction to my tenure overseeing the typographical study of the 

Eremite's oeuvre; all queries should now be left in the soil for me, and faith taken that the worms 

will find me. They will not find <span class="red">____</span>Clerk<span class="red">____</span> Chester-Stokes. Following her promotion up 

and out of clerkhood, I will be taking her place. Though this may come as a shock and relief to 

many of you, I would ask you not to speak too ill of her, or groan too loudly; she will still be 

amongst you, in a supervisory role. However, those of you who tired of her constant boasts about 

her breeding, her overbearing attendance to every Excavation, her insistence on the use of proper 

Latin, regardless of a <span class="red">____</span>clerk's<span class="red">_///</span> mother tongue, the smug accomplishments of her parents, their 

riches, their castle high on some muggy moor, you may be secure in the knowledge that your Work 

may begin afresh, free of interference. For those of you who miss her most comforting words and 

coos, the ones on the edge of hearing, hear this.

<span class="red">SHHHHHHH</span>

Poppets!

<p>

Poppets!

<p>

Eventually, you know, you know, her size would have affected her performance; while it is this 

<span class="red">____</span>clerk's<span class="red">____</span> opinion that all women are destined to grow fat, I could not allow the Institute's 

published results to be compromised by slovenly, tubular fingers. Her new role is still suited to her 

suffocating presence, as well as her instincts of motherhood, and she should be extremely proud of 

her promotions; they have carried her further than any of her kind before. 
</p>
<p>

I believe that I have proved my competence in these matters, and take on her role with aplomb, 

though it grieves me to present her despicable transcript as true Work, completed when she was 

only a young <span class="red">\\\\</span>clerk<span class="red">////</span>, newly arrived and smooth of promotion. It had been made necessary by 

some hidden vandalism deep below the earth, in which the original was lost to us. Her original 

notes were condescending and incomplete, and have been discarded, or truncated.
</p>
<p>

A lesser Work, full of inconsistencies of pathos and inelegant turns of phrase. She has almost 

certainly made mistakes; even the pigments are wrong, diluted dustings of the Eremite's own ink. 

Perhaps it was her, bumbling through the Ouse, that ripped the original, priceless shard in twain, 

and brought us this scratching instead?
