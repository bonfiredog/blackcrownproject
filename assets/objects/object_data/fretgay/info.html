Any clerk unearthing should dispose of the object on the wind.

<b>Notes</b>
<p>
Despite constant correspondence to the contrary, this particular piece of refuse has surfaced again and again and again, clasped to the chest of countless poor <span class="red">\\\\</span>clerks<span class="red">////</span> who believe that they have uncovered something marvellous. Do not let the pattern deceive you; this is refuse, designed to be discarded, an ephemera marked only with the tabulations of breaths once made, mucus once blown, and worries once worried. The blood, I <span class="red">imagine</span>, wakes something up inside you, but do not overdo it; there was no excitement here. He only used it to dab at his tubes when they leaked.
</p>
<p>
If you require yet another hypothetical exercise to steady you, <span class="red">imagine</span> this; the Eremite stood before you, your knees shaking at how tall he is, how elegant, how nimble his hands and how developed his cranium. Now <span class="red">imagine</span> presenting him with this gift, from his deep past. Now, <span class="red">imagine</span> him laughing gently at your efforts, at the efforts of idiots who would build a cargo cult around his hankies!
</p>
<p>
The exercise is completed.
</p>
<p>
The only point of note is the patterning; the <i>fleur de coquette</i> on an azure field is consistent with the other parlayware in the Eremiteâ€™s possession; as many of you will know from your Work, the Eremite enjoyed his possessions in sets, and was nothing but a completist. 
</p>
<p>
I have made a note of those <span class="red">\\\\</span>clerks<span class="red">____ </span>who have excavated this windblow, and reviewed their Works for patterns of their own; they are the sort of <span class="red">\\\\</span>clerk<span class="red">____</span> who would think of their mother, or the last time their father kissed them, when they were in pain. Whose House Style would go too far, would be tight and curled like a pubis, and whose designation would never rise past <span class="red">____</span>this<span class="red">////</span>; one hand gripped in pain around this vestige, the other open and flapping, making their Work indelicate and doltish. Those of you who have excavated this lacey chaff, against my instructions, consider your promotions stalled. You could not take the agony.   
</p>
<p>
Whichever <span class="red">__\\</span>clerk<span class="red">//_/</span>, whichever flower in the pattern, comes across this object next, conduct the following:
</p>
<p>
- Do <span class="red">NNNOT</span> keep it.
</p>
<p>
- Either:
     - toss it to the wind; 
    - rip it to shreds (trotters permitting);
    - throw it in the river (trotters permitting);
</p>
<p>
- Do <span class="red">NNNOT</span> bury it afresh.  
</p>
<p>
- Do <span class="red">NNNOT</span> fiddle with it, or attempt to put it in your mouth. It is dirty; very dirty. 
</p>
<p>
- Forget about it. Forget that it even existed, because, truly, if you <span class="red">imagine</span> it properly, it did not; it was only there briefly, in his gorgeous hand, to catch whatever flakes of himself tried to escape.
