<b>Trottering Notes:</b> Fragment grouping conducted by <span class="red">\__\</span>Clerk<span class="red">/_//</span> Chester-Stokes, though her theory has as of yet not been submitted. Second-party analysis leads to conclusion that these are all extracts from very disparate parts of the Pilot's Book; the near-destruction of some, and the preservation of others, and the nature of their degradation, supports this theorem. The same sodium damage and sluice patterns are evident as in other fragments, but some of the fragments, most notably Fragment 3, have been carbonised with a pepper flame of 26,000K. If the editor has olfactory rights, they may detect a hint of burbage and cinnamon about the fragment.

<p>Consider this my theory. An editor must work within extremely tight confines of mind and matter, and assumptions based on incomplete evidence, whilst occasionally contaminatory, can elucidate new modes of thinking. By combining the fragments in this manner, some ripped deliberately from their binding, others teased by the motions of wave and wind, I hope to draw something from them, some connection which maybe the Eremite intended, but was unable to pronounce without ripping his protopus to shreds.</p>
