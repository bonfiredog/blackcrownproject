<span class="red">____</span><i>Experto Crede</i><span class="red">____</span>
</p>
<p>It has been an era since I have turned my hand to transcription, and it is never a happy day when that hand is forced. A Work that is dying, its intricacies blurring and ribboning, is a sadder thing than losing one's child, I <span class="red">imagine</span>. All that is left here to handle is a dog-ear, or perhaps the ring-finger, of what once was. There is little to identify its provenance, nothing of the <i>caput</i>, or the <i>cor</i>, only his latitude, the stars.</P>

<p>It is lucky then, <span class="red">___\</span>clerks<span class="red">//_/</span>, that I am adapted to such calamities, and possess an Alexandrian memory. It must have been all the declensions that I was forced to learn. </p>

<p>Can any of you, in your states, remember your parents?</p>

<span class="red">SHHHHHHHHHHHHHH</span>

<p>I do. I remember the day that Daddy sped off in the sidecar. It was not June, and so the rock-rose was bloody in the clints. Mummy and I followed in the wagon, across the virgate and down to the port, and watched him standing, on the deck of Mummy's ferry, shouting that he would 'knock up some Boche ponces', or some equally stupid Babel, translated on the wind. </p>

<p>His sergeant brought back his wedding ring before Guy Fawkes Night. As Norris served him tea, he told us how twenty privates had tried to steal it from his pocket, as he zigged and zagged his way back to England through the trenches. I can see it so very clearly, the herringbone of his trousers, and the little cardboard box perched atop them. I loved that comparison; it looked a little like our house, stood in fertile fields.</p>

<p>The sergeant opened the box, and took out, very carefully, twenty fingers, and laid them on the Pembroke table. Of course, none of them were Daddy's, and so we shooed the sergeant from our life. We fed the fingers to the pigs. </p>

<p>It would pay all of you, <span class="red">___\</span>clerks<span class="red">//_/</span>, to practice. Remember the little things. What did they call the herbs and flowers, where you were from? What weather touched you?</p>

<p>Exercises for another time. </p>

<p>No matter how much I might remember of this Work, day after day after day we are losing more of what he was planning to say. This Work was a series of notations, for some grander, dreamt mural. I do wish that we had Uncle Oscar's writings here, and Praester's unshredded and sensible. Together, they might flare into so many of those trenches in my revision. </p>

<p>Without the whole Work, for instance, we will never know what Friend was really like, as a person, or whether she did love him, as he so desperate to be loved. We will never know what became of the Bog Ponies, or whether the Town Cryer was a man or a woman or something else, or what it was that the Eremite did to Mr. Lights, in those lonely, ultimate days on the valley floor.</p>

<p>What we have instead, left behind, is a quinquereme preparation, an <i>itinerarium</i> of travel out of Loss, a road diary a little more juvenile than most. Only one scrap of page remains; let us see quite how much of the rest I remember, from previous readings. It is puzzling; the rest of me is waning, planing down to the grain, but my mind stays as sharp as an <i>ensis</i>. I have not quite descended to the sty just yet.</p>

<p>I think that I might know who I am.</p>

<p>I cannot be expected to remember quite everything, <i>veritas</i>;. The parts that I do remember I have put into order of pressure, as best I am able, and though I am no artist I have provided descriptions of the sketches and scenes that made a particular impression on my young mind. All stress is the Eremite's, not my own, though gaps may be in my own knowledge or in the record itself. </p>

<p>Firstly, the <i>contexte</i>. It seems that the Eremite was by now already on the long road out of Loss, the caprine, darting track plotted in the stars and the breadcrumbs of himself, trudging in the other direction all that time before. We may assume, from the notes that he made on each day of his journey, that he was finding it hard to delude himself any longer. His guilt at the death of Loss, at the dousing of an entire folk, is so impregnated throughout. Look at the records of his breath, recorded every evening. We can <span class="red">imagine</span> that he did not sleep much. Nor was there any reason to hide these records; he was so assured of his companion's illiteracy that he knew that his crimes would never be understood. What were thirty-nine scratches, every single day, to a Friend?</p>

<p>The records of breath do confirm one of the Eremite's virtues; throughout his entire life, no matter his dimension, he was extremely regular in every faculty. Look to the tabulations and calculations throughout <i>The Underweather Vanity</i>. He has even boasted, in other Works, of cults marking their festivals by his toilet. And indeed, the breaths here do form a calendar; thirty nine, without fail, in and out, every single day. </p>

<p>However, as you all should have been taught, every calendar has its leap. There was one such energetic day, in Loss, a hot day when he was unsated by the cooking of the very worst cook, and decided to eat from a different sort of plate.</p>

<p>The Eremite has made no secret in the record that he wanted Friend, in that childish way that we have all come to recognise. I thought that I might have to puzzle it out, this calamity that murdered a public, but he was almost triumphant in his blatancy.</p>

<p>On the day that he removed his mask and kissed her, he registered only thirty breaths, in and out of his tubes.</p>

<p>Nine is not an important number, in any theology that I know of, but he would spend the rest of his time in Loss fixated upon those lost breaths, trying not to accuse himself. <i>I feel well</i>, we can <span class="red">imagine</span> him telling himself, <i>there is nothing wrong with me</i>, as they moaned through the dirt all around him. He was always so excellent at <span class="red">imagining</span> other outcomes and other blames. Perhaps he might have blamed Friend for distracting him, for making him lose count that day, for some atmospheric disturbance, the influence of spirits, anything, but his own want. </p>

<p>You can just <span class="red">imagine</span> him, can't you, boygirls, on the road, checking her from temple to temple, looking for any sort of mantle, probing her mouth with those incredible fingers, hunting for cobblestones. He would even check her back, for the bruises that the rest of her people developed, evidence, he thought, of flagellation. </p>

<p>But, of course, he would find nothing on her, and so reinforce his delusion that he had not infected them. She did not wear a black crown, and so he enthroned her in other ways, certain of his innocence. If she was well, the only one who had smelt his breath in a hundred years, then he could not be accused.</p>

<p>But who was there still to accuse him? </p>

<p>The pigs, for all their lack of discernment, did teach me something as a girl. I often found them very gross, and would stand at the edge of the sty after school, shouting my subjunctives in and listening for the screams back.</p>

<p>Mummy and Daddy showed me, however, how the beasts could be used as a barometer. About five times in my infanthood a plague would pass through the herd, and they were loath to cull the whole lot. And so they would quietly walk amongst them, wearing homemade masks out of sack and snorkel, and make an inspection. They would ignore the sows turning out cold paste instead of milk, ignore the backfatters grinding their teeth into flour, ignore the boars corning each other in blind rages. </p>

<p>Before long, they would find the happiest pig, the one without sores or mucus, and lead it off to be shot, far from any watercourse.</p>

but last night I dreamt of a fish<br/>
<br/>
<i>mercenaria mercenaria</i><br/>
<br/>
was a noble beast, when I met it, but all this hunger now<br/>
 is making me impolite; am imagining it steamed with butter<br/>
<br/>
it brought me to <br/>
<br/>
<span class="red">[A<i> lacunae</i>.]</span><br/>
<br/>
Ring-In-Opal, on the red tide. It was a pleasant journey with the Lord Quahog, most royal of his kind, and he let me touch the crown jewels nestled in his bivalve. I can almost taste the jacuzzi of blood that I sat in, reclining on his anus. It was too cold for algae, so we motored through the floes, up to the boundary of Ring-In-Opal itself, two slabs of bull ice<br/>
<br/>
I remember the mist coiling off them with envy <br/>
is so hot here today<br/>
all the suns have followed me<br/>
 a fold of them in the SSS <br/>
<br/>
i sent her on ahead instead<br/>
 gave the smaller luggage<br/>
telling to meet me in two days<br/>
she will not get far<br/>
she is sik<span class="red">[sic]</span> with an empty belly<br/>
 but not homesick one bit<br/>
<br/>
I think shes forgotten about them all already<br/>
<br/>
i can think clearly now, with her gone <br/>
 I can spend the day in Ring-In-Opal<br/>
<br/>
I had long since said farewell to Lord Quahog, and been amongst them for many days, before I met Whale-bane. He considered himself a bard, and though he was not much of a singer, just a boy in a fine coat, all he did was pluck. He knew gut very well. They all did, in Ring-In-Opal. <br/>
<br/>
They liked me there.<br/>
<br/>
I remember, floating over the diplomat behind me on swim bladders - they loved that, too, it was all the more ice, all the more territory, for them. There was not a horse chestnut for leagues, but it didn't matter<br/>
<br/>
Every day, before he found the courage to introduce himself, he watched me from his berg, the skins drawn around his waist, brown walrus, or was it white?
I saw the tusks above his bed<br/>
<br/>
<span class="red">[[A large lacunae.]]</span><br/>
<br/>
every morning i have unpacked large Parlayware table <br/>
and chairs from Dunnage #67<br/>
 to simulate breakfast, but she has always refused to sit on them<br/>
 <br/>
Ring-In-Opal, as a civilisation, did not have chairs either, but unlike Friend they were fascinated by them. Whale-bane, especially, could not quite decipher their purpose. I laughed too harshly, when he first tried to sit down; with those swimmer's thighs, he just wailed and wailed and fell onto the ice<br/>
<br/>
I can see him, now, flailing and flirting. When his brothers got him up, it took off a layer of skin, leaving behind a tattered memoir of our day together<br/>
<br/>

 the heat  becoming unbearable  <br/>
there were <span class="red">[…]</span> suns, in consolation, scalding the sap out of trees<br/>
<br/>
so I sat in alpine water and did not care about her<br/>
<br/>
I dreamt again of Whale-bane, of Ring-In-Opal, of being back amongst his people. I dreamt of the afternoon that they took me to their Mint. Whale-Bane himself led the hunt for the gold; he was the elegance of his people, and I can imagine him now, standing in his furs on the prow of a particularly grand berg, harpoon in hand, his cock tanned with circulation despite the blizzard <br/>
<br/>
 they spotted a pod, a few miles out, and diving like snakes, like dragons, into the white-capped waves, before long they brought the corpses ashore, a calf and its mother, and out of the groins, the mother's the size of a doorway, they pulled a pair of golden rings. Whale-bane had made the kill, and so he took the rings, currency pierced there by his grandfathers and great-grandfathers, for safekeeping, and spent them as inheritance.<br/>
<br/>
One passed to me, the other to his brother, as a debt paid. <br/>
<br/>
I danced and skidded with my handsome Whale-bane on the snow while the corpses of the fish were slid into the water behind us. I would not stay for his brother's piercing, and I was afraid that they would do the same to me.<br/>
<br/>
I asked him that night if they ever ate whale, and he laughed that jackal laugh of his, him who had never seen something with more than two legs, and said<br/>
<br/>
you cannot eat money<br/>

did tell her how much I held my breath for her<br/>
<br/>
didnt tell her how I had crief<span class="red">[sic]</span> for her, when I thought<br/>
that she was dead, in the catafalque yard<br/>
<br/>
havent even asked her for another kiss<br/>
<br/>
what a bizarre proposal now<br/>
why use a mouth<br/>
<br/>
<span class="red">[A lacunae.]</span><br/>
<br/>
weve stopped<br/>
<br/>
She doesn't really understand me<br/>
She just standing there<br/>
screaming me to get up<br/> 
all day<br/>
until polyps grow<br/>
 ungrateful for the rescue<br/>
 from the plague<br/>
 from the life<br/>
 from the father<br/>
<br/>
do not mind<br/>
 We are nearly, nearly homeward bound<br/> 
thinking about whalebone and really<br/> 
 smell the sea now<br/> 
even through kerchief<br/>
and what was it that Parlay said<br/>
<br/>
<i><strike>all of the lovely<br/>
<br/>
all of the beuatiful were<br/>
<br/>
all of the beatific moved across Ileum</strike><br/>
<br/>
'All of the beautiful died at Troy.' </i><br/>
