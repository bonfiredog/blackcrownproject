A tidal chart?

Why is a tube the best shape? Could trap things, instead. 

Congregate around rivers

End game is usually the most important part.

Annoying grind and recylced content

Free to play can involve stripping your game. Doesn't work for big budgets. 

The minutae, not the big story. 

Need to bring them in enough, with hints of more, not shoving it in their faces. 

How my status does not change compared to you, but still feel threatened

Relatedness



Singleplayer - interacting with others. 

Get people in, maybe they will pay, and then they will pay more. 

Lock out parts of the story. 

Commerce, competition, social ties. What are lots of different ways to do it.

Influencers - speak to them. 

This is a "messy" game

Tatterdelion

Pandiculation - yawning is a huge faux pas

Guilt is a primary mechanic but try and promote it, not force it in. 

Sam stuff is hidden, censored. 

A man about to fall off his chair

Voices from God in his head - not in his head, as empirical as it can be. Quales show madness.
