Under the ground

White, thinks that it is bird stuff - sees it splattered on the rock

He has to get it out of the suit - the bathetic can help him

Suite of rooms going off into the darkness

Lots of options to do stuff

MENACES - pain, filth

Venns

No masks below

Stuff in the walls

Give something of which you only have one

I am semed

Relict cave

You cannot tell how cold it is

Run away - an always card?

More bunker-like - decontamination?

She cannot spell, annoying voice

Has pushed its way up
