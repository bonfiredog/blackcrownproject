ways to remember things

to think you made them up at a later date
to half-remember them 
to remember something fondly
to remember something with malice
to forget about something
to remember something vividly
to forget about certain pieces
to block something out
to know something differently with hindsight
to force yourself to remember, to preserve it.
to have things be instinctive
to have things be learned
repeating things to remember them
Remembering something from a smell.
