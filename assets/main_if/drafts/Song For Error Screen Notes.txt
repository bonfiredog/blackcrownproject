There was once, before there were birds, a bird.
He was a gorgeous bird

Too much smoke
Related to pigs?
What happened to him?
Why do we want to be told stories
He lived in the Owl's House
forty days
had to get through lines of stuff
beautiful land with lots of trees
Storm game
A seagull, or an albatross
He has to go underground a lot
WHOSOEVER BREAKS ME WILL BREATHE MY BREATH AND SEE WHAT I SEE
song of forty days
