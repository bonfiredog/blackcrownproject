# Using This Archive

The Black Crown Project was an **interactive fiction** found in various, decoupled places across the Internet. It was funded, edited and published Random House UK, (now <a href="http://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/">Penguin Random House</a>), and the technical aspects were developed and supervised by <a href="www.failbettergames.com/">Failbetter Games</a> and <a href="http://www.popleaf.com/">Popleaf Games</a>. <a href="http://bonfiredog.co.uk">I</a> wrote and designed the narrative.

The project was in active development between late 2011 and late 2013, with new elements being released every few months. It was still accessible until the last months of 2014, when it was taken offline due to a variety of factors which have been more than handled elsewhere. Since then, the copyright has reverted in full to me, and over the last six months or so I have been able to get hold of most (but importantly not all) the material associated with the project. It isn't in any fit state to merely rehost, however; many of the proprietary technologies that it relied upon no longer exist. While I do (now) have the technical ability to redevelop the project myself, I do not have either the inclination or the time to do so. I also cannot trust myself to not suffer a death by a thousand edits, and spend the next *x* years of my life 'updating' what was, really, a very specific piece of work for a very specific time in my life.

However, I did not want to let all of that work, by myself and many talented others, to merely succumb to bitrot on my hard drive. I have no interest in trying to make any further money from the Project (I never made much in the first place), yet I know that it disappointed many people to lose the vast amount of material which, in most cases, they were only partway through processing. To that end, this entire archive is being released for *libre* non-commercial use by anybody, anywhere, to any degree. More details can be found on the License page.

# The Narrative

# The Game Itself

Game was split into areas - describe them, what they were for. Had their own title-bar.

Social Acts were used briefly to allow limited interaction between players. Competitive or cooperative, quality changes.

# Understanding This Repo

This Github repository contains absolutely everything that I have collected, and have in my possession, relating to *The Black Crown Project*. This includes not only all the files and assets from the narrative itself, but also as much of the metatextual material that I could find and digitise; notes, drafts, sketches, research images, raw Photoshop files, photographs, and earlier versions of the Project from my Masters degree. Some things are missing, and seem to be irretrievable; I only have the fole markers of many of the production notes, design documents and early drafts hosted on Google Docs, due to a bad misunderstanding on my part as to how that technology works. All the posts from the user forums, where so many of you took my fiction to hear, are gone. The long list of 'qualities' from the interactive fiction, whose flavour text were some of the most pleasurable writing that I have done in recent years, were also lost when the Project was archived. 

I have only redacted material where it contained the personal contact information of my friends. 

To satisfy something very fundamental in me, I have laid out this archive in as simple and segregated a manner as possible. Everything can be found in the `/assets` folder, grouped into sub-folders roughly by medium.  

### `/audio` 
These audio tracks were the recordings (made by the Eremite) which the player could find within the interactive fiction and then play using the *Player* object, found in the `/objects` folder. The audio files are also hosted there, but I was worried that the two  were slightly different, in some way


These files were attached to some of the virtual objects found in the `/objects` folder: in their excavations, the player could discover a sort of ouija teapot that played the sound of its leaves. I don't know why either. These two files were created by me in my back garden: included are their design documents.










Living Stories - running in real tiem; basically you can have a quality change after a set amount of time. Used for increasing the severity of diseases, representing the passage of time etc.

They are in some sort of order. Child Event is the result of a branch. But not in chronological order. That would take some time to put together. Look at the drafts and other planning documents to understand that.

In BCP, files were displayed on the main screen, representing your character's desk. Files would only appear if you had the correct qualities for them; this was how the flow of story was controlled. Typically, completing certain files would give you qualities that made availble other files. BCP had what was called a 'river structure'; there was a chain of files which moved you forward through the story, but along the way there were alternate routes you could take, and short diversions before rejoining the main 'flow'.

Some files had a 'Nex' value. This was to do with Storynexus' micropayments system, which works very well for games like Fallen London but which, in retrospect, was a dismally bad decision for the game I was making. Please ignore them, and please, even if we agree that you can make a commercial version of BCP, DO NOT use micropayments. I am not a big fan. 

If you want to create a straight port, Storynexus is probably a good bet.

The other main part of the storygame were additional items found outside in the world. These were hosted elsewhere on the web, and represented items which the player-character could dig up or find in the exploration of the Widsith Institute. The URLs to them were obscure, but not obfuscated; people were able to find them naturally, and share them with others. Players of the narrative text game could also find them in the game, and then use a special storylet to access them at any time. These were split into two main types: miasma objects and text shards.

see in screenshot folder how things were supposed to look.

Put screenshots in the instructions document.

Miasma Objects, built by the incomparable Popleaf Studios, were objects which could be manipulated in your browser; tactile puzzles. As well as adding to the lore of Black Crown, they also served a mechanical purpose; when and if they were 'solved', they would create an Access Code back into the Storynexus game, prompting curious newcomers to create a character and start playing the main story with a small bonus. Please note that the code for the Miasma Objects is not currently part of this archive: I'm still chasing it up.

Text Shards represented pages from the Eremite's diaries which, in a similar fashion, both players of the text game and curious web-trawlers could read. They were similar in style and format to the Miasma Objects, but could not be manipulated other than by turning pages, and did not have any Access codes assoiciated with them.

Both types also included a commentary underneath; notes by past Widsith archivists about their interpretations of the object.

- `/bcp_scrivener_project` - I used the [Scrivener](https://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.php) project software for collating notes and planning assets during the production process: to open this `.scriv` file, you will also need a copy of this (paid-for) software: however, I think that you can explore this folder's structure and find the various pages of the project as `.rtf` files.

- `main_if` - These are all the files I have relating to the main interactive fiction of the Project, originally built using Storynexus. The `/art` folder contains all the icons for the Storynexus cards painted by Paul Arendt at Failbetter, as well as the area banners, as well as many of the work-in-progress icons and their original `.psd` files. The `/drafts` folder contains many of the Storynexus storylets in word documents, which is where I tended to draft them in groups of ten or twenty. The `/planning` folder is a mixed bag of notes, scraps of storylet, design instructions, pointless screeds, mock-ups, reference images (mainly from the [British Library](http://bl.co.uk) and te [Wellcome Library](http://wellcomeimages.org/) online archives), icon sketches and photographs from the production of the project. The `bcp_narrative_export.xlsx` spreadsheet is a raw JSON export of *all* the storylets, with their branches, from the Storynexus project. There are hundreds of thousands of words in here, with all the original HTML markup, arranged in no particular order. Good luck. in main_if - reference images mainly from wellcome collection and british library.

- `objects` - At the moment, this folder only contains sketches, design documents and descriptions of the Miasma Objects. I'm trying to get hold of the actual HTML files and art assets for the digital objects themselves.

- `old_project` - This contains all the files relating to the original version of the project as work done during my Master's degree at the University of Exeter.

- `promo`- All of the assets that we used to promote the project, and which I could retrieve, I have put in here: talks I gave at various events, blog posts, teaser videos and artwork.

- `screenshots` - These selected shots are mainly for reference as to how the project looked onscreen: both the main interactive fiction, the 'text shards' and the Miasma Objects.

- `supplements` - As part of the marketing of the project, I created several documents which introduced readers to the themes of the Black Crown Project, all of which were written under pseudonyms: transcribed interviews between pig farmers and government employees, short stories about Abraham Lincoln jugging his aides (you should have seen the Amazon reviews), dissertations on valley civilisations, and several others. All drafts, final and working, are collected here.

- `text_shards` - This contains the drafts, notes, design direction, Photoshop files and final PDFs of the fragments of the Eremite's diary that the player could dig from beneath the Institute. The original paintings, of which there are only photos, are still at the Random House offices, I think.


 

When it was active, the Project allowed you to take on the persona of a new employee at the Widsith Institute, a rather strange archival institution tasked with disinterring, sorting and analysing the buried belongings and writings of a long-gone explorer, known by various names but most commonly as the Miasma Eremite. The Institue was not an ordinary employer, and you were not an ordinary employee; after your interview, you were infected with a strange disease, one of several, sealed inside a thick rubber suit and taken your desk, set atop a high hill in a rolling landscape of hills, by an empty sea. You were surrounded by other clerks of the company, sealed in their own suits, and separated by wide painted blue circles into which you were quarantined. As you spent time at the Institute, you learnt more about its strange culture, and your place within it; you attempted to communicate with other clerks, exploreiod the tunnels and caverns beneath the hill, included the large excavation from which came most of the Eremite's artefacts. You walked the seashore, and glimpsed shadowy figures in the mist. You were infected with new diseases, in lieu of promotion. You discovered more about your own past, through dreams and the objects that you had swallowed for safekeeping, making reappearances in your suit. You tried to resist going to the toilet, for fear of drowning in your suit. You drank dew from the tall funnel that rose above your head. You met strange beings, including Wayle, the lithe, tall superior clerk dressed only in a towel who directed your efforts, and the Shushbaby, an enormous, obese monster which sang you to sleep when your 'promotions' caused you too much pain. You could ocassionally directly contact another player through Storynexus' 'Social Acts' feature, trying to make yourself understood without language, and through the pain of your 'promotions', gifting each other quality changes.

Your main work, of course, was the Black Crown Project itself; a particular series of works by the Eremite, and the possessions relating to them, which you were tasked with finding in the caves beneath the hill and bringing into the light for analysis. The Eremite had been an explorer, one with strange powers, and who found places which nobody else had found. The Black Crown Project concerned his account of his journey to a town called Loss, hidden in a mountain valley and given to strange rituals, beliefs and livelihoods. As your time at your desk lengthened, and you explored further afield, and met others working on their own Projects, and earned new 'promotions' which improved your abilities further, you came to learn that the connections between the Clerks, the Eremite and yourself were closer than you thought. 

This story was experienced on lots of different forms and locales, which added together to form the entire experience. The main body consisted of an interactive fiction game; this was where you created a character and explored the Institute, uncovering fragments of the Eremite's writings, traversing the world and discovering the Institute's secrets. It was built using a modified version of Failbetter Games' Storynexus engine, which is now in maintenance mode and I'm not sure will ever be re-released fully. In this game, you created an account and a character, and once you had reached your desk chose which stories to play by clicking on animated files; you might choose to look around you at other clerks, leave your desk to explore, or descend into the caverns to find another piece of work. In these stories you read text, and then made choices based upon your character's abilities, your current situation and your past choices. These choices were remembered by the game, and choices might have improved your character's abilities, given them new items, or revealed new information. The consequences of some choices did not become apparent until much later in the game. Some choices, particularly interesting or consequential ones, were originally locked unless you paid a small amount of Nex; the proprietary currency used by Storynexus, exchangeable for real money. Your character's progress was kept track of using 'qualities', attributes, traits, histories, memories, abilities and disadvantages which they accumulated by progressing through the interactive fiction, and which could lock off or open up certain files, or certain choices within files.

Out from, and apart from this game were the many fragments of the experience. These were hosted in other places around the Internet, and could either be collected and discovered within the game or found at random; none of them were locked behind a paywall or a password. These included the writings of the Eremite, scrawled onto blackened, moulding sheets of paper and annotated with the thoughts of other clerks who had dug them up before you. There were strange objects owned or collected by the Eremite, rendered in pseudo-3D in your browser and which you could manipulate, either as a curiosity or a puzzle to be solved; if you solved the puzzle, it provided you with a route into the game, and a bonus to your character. There were short fictions, written under pseudonyms and released online with very little material connection to the Project itself, but which provided much context and backstory to the storyworld; transcribed interviews, short stories, essays and poems. There were audio recordings to listen to, experienced by added different dried powders to a strange porcelain contraption like a teapot and holding the spout to your ear. There was a forum, in which all the users spoke in character (even for bug reports), and where characters from the game would ocassionally leave behind messages.
