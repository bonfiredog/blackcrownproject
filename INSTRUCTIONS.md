Storynexus is in maintenance mode - development of new features is unlikely. 
Not sure how long it will be around for.

Game was split into areas - describe them, what they were for. Had their own title-bar.

Social Acts were used briefly to allow limited interaction between players. Competitive or cooperative, quality changes.

Living Stories - running in real tiem; basically you can have a quality change after a set amount of time. Used for increasing the severity of diseases, representing the passage of time etc.

They are in some sort of order. Child Event is the result of a branch. But not in chronological order. That would take some time to put together. Look at the drafts and other planning documents to understand that.

The qualities are gone, however.

In BCP, files were displayed on the main screen, representing your character's desk. Files would only appear if you had the correct qualities for them; this was how the flow of story was controlled. Typically, completing certain files would give you qualities that made availble other files. BCP had what was called a 'river structure'; there was a chain of files which moved you forward through the story, but along the way there were alternate routes you could take, and short diversions before rejoining the main 'flow'.

Some files had a 'Nex' value. This was to do with Storynexus' micropayments system, which works very well for games like Fallen London but which, in retrospect, was a dismally bad decision for the game I was making. Please ignore them, and please, even if we agree that you can make a commercial version of BCP, DO NOT use micropayments. I am not a big fan. 

If you want to create a straight port, Storynexus is probably a good bet.

The other main part of the storygame were additional items found outside in the world. These were hosted elsewhere on the web, and represented items which the player-character could dig up or find in the exploration of the Widsith Institute. The URLs to them were obscure, but not obfuscated; people were able to find them naturally, and share them with others. Players of the narrative text game could also find them in the game, and then use a special storylet to access them at any time. These were split into two main types: miasma objects and text shards.

see in screenshot folder how things were supposed to look.

Put screenshots in the instructions document.

Miasma Objects, built by the incomparable Popleaf Studios, were objects which could be manipulated in your browser; tactile puzzles. As well as adding to the lore of Black Crown, they also served a mechanical purpose; when and if they were 'solved', they would create an Access Code back into the Storynexus game, prompting curious newcomers to create a character and start playing the main story with a small bonus. Please note that the code for the Miasma Objects is not currently part of this archive: I'm still chasing it up.

Text Shards represented pages from the Eremite's diaries which, in a similar fashion, both players of the text game and curious web-trawlers could read. They were similar in style and format to the Miasma Objects, but could not be manipulated other than by turning pages, and did not have any Access codes assoiciated with them.

Both types also included a commentary underneath; notes by past Widsith archivists about their interpretations of the object.

- `/audio` - These files were attached to some of the virtual objects found in the `/objects` folder: in their excavations, the player could discover a sort of ouija teapot that played the sound of its leaves. I don't know why either. These two files were created by me in my back garden: included are their design documents.

- `/bcp_scrivener_project` - I used the [Scrivener](https://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.php) project software for collating notes and planning assets during the production process: to open this `.scriv` file, you will also need a copy of this (paid-for) software: however, I think that you can explore this folder's structure and find the various pages of the project as `.rtf` files.

- `main_if` - These are all the files I have relating to the main interactive fiction of the Project, originally built using Storynexus. The `/art` folder contains all the icons for the Storynexus cards painted by Paul Arendt at Failbetter, as well as the area banners, as well as many of the work-in-progress icons and their original `.psd` files. The `/drafts` folder contains many of the Storynexus storylets in word documents, which is where I tended to draft them in groups of ten or twenty. The `/planning` folder is a mixed bag of notes, scraps of storylet, design instructions, pointless screeds, mock-ups, reference images (mainly from the [British Library](http://bl.co.uk) and te [Wellcome Library](http://wellcomeimages.org/) online archives), icon sketches and photographs from the production of the project. The `bcp_narrative_export.xlsx` spreadsheet is a raw JSON export of *all* the storylets, with their branches, from the Storynexus project. There are hundreds of thousands of words in here, with all the original HTML markup, arranged in no particular order. Good luck. in main_if - reference images mainly from wellcome collection and british library.

- `objects` - At the moment, this folder only contains sketches, design documents and descriptions of the Miasma Objects. I'm trying to get hold of the actual HTML files and art assets for the digital objects themselves.

- `old_project` - This contains all the files relating to the original version of the project as work done during my Master's degree at the University of Exeter.

- `promo`- All of the assets that we used to promote the project, and which I could retrieve, I have put in here: talks I gave at various events, blog posts, teaser videos and artwork.

- `screenshots` - These selected shots are mainly for reference as to how the project looked onscreen: both the main interactive fiction, the 'text shards' and the Miasma Objects.

- `supplements` - As part of the marketing of the project, I created several documents which introduced readers to the themes of the Black Crown Project, all of which were written under pseudonyms: transcribed interviews between pig farmers and government employees, short stories about Abraham Lincoln jugging his aides (you should have seen the Amazon reviews), dissertations on valley civilisations, and several others. All drafts, final and working, are collected here.

- `text_shards` - This contains the drafts, notes, design direction, Photoshop files and final PDFs of the fragments of the Eremite's diary that the player could dig from beneath the Institute. The original paintings, of which there are only photos, are still at the Random House offices, I think.

### Late Acknowledgements

If I have forgotten anyone, it is entirely my own fault for being forgetful, and not theirs for being forgettable. 

- [Sam North](https://humanities.exeter.ac.uk/english/staff/snorth/), the closest thing to a benevolent dolmen-spirit that I have, albeit with far better (and more transparent) shirts, hair and soul. Thank you for your guidance, your attention, your humour, the white wine, the traipsing around London with a heavy suitcase covered in biohazard stickers, dinner on Dartmoor, and for everything else. I miss you.
