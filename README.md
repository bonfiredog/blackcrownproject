*The Black Crown Project* was like pulling something by its root, agonisingly, so I'll try to do this quickly.

A year and a half ago, the *Project* went offline, for a variety of very good reasons. A couple of people were vaguely upset, diluted, even homeopathically. It had been a droplet in their life, and now the tang had gone. I wasn't one of them; I washed my mouth of it some time ago. 

Black Crown derived any fibrous strength, any torque or depth that it had, from its cluster and its colony, and the relative obscuring mugginess in which it existed; so I will try to dissect it as fully as I can, laying it all out in one dimension.

I am very gratefuly for everything that the Black Crown Project gave me; friends, new interests, a career into which I am still slowly falling. It was two years of sheer invention, of writing and drawing and playing. I wrote about the King Quahog and riding in his jelly, how drowning in your own filth can be be experienced as a story of struggle; the power of toast as an anti-depressant. I wrote a topology of myself, a part-atomisation into long chunks and flecks of meaning. I had not really considered, in those days, being a computational artist; I had made some odd things in analogue, and had done some HTML coding; and it took me some time to realise that making thing digitally and computationally was the best way to make the things I wanted to make. Computers can simulate anything, and I wanted to make anything. Now I am building artificial intelligence, teaching conditional narrative to people who are paying hundreds of pounds for the privilege. As then, I still feel entirely unqualified; but my life has changed in other ways. I am better. I have lived in the green hills that inspired BCP. 

Black Crown was all about quarantine, stymy, barriers, relays, distance; about holding itself together, and being terrified of loss. And yet some things have been lost, and I am sorry. 

And yet, when the copyright reverted to me in the late last year, I thought only briefly about revdeveloping it myself. I have most of the ability, now; unlike then, when I relied on ta dialysis of talent others to make anything happen. Then, I had the time; I don't now, and I think that's a blessing.

I re-read almost every word, when I was putting this archive together; the length of it was something, writing that much and letting others see it; but when there is so much writing, it becomes an act of self-forestry, of make the trees to obscure the wood. The Black crown Project is something of which I am proud, even if I never was when I was making it. Every time I touch it again it makes me feel a little ill. The talent of those around me, the inaccessibility of their process, only made my own defiiciencies worse. I felt like the dicky heart at the centre, the trick hip, the gip back. I was, in a very inappropriate word, unwell. While I was unwell, I was creating something that was about that illness; the diagrams that the Eremite draws are the diagrams that I drew, at school, in the back of my notebook, while I exused myself to go to the toilet and cry. The Institute is what I feared my own mind was. It wasn't cathartic to make this Project, or healthy. I was standing in my illness while I was trying to solve it, like a flower in bad water, a sleeping finger in a glass, or a damp cellar full of mushrooms. The evidence is there; the walks crying in hoodies and no shoes, thinking of the pressure I was putting myself under, and that others were trying to relieve. The CMS like tunnel vision, like thumbscrews. I was a horror to work with or be with , and I hope that I made everybody better people as a result. 

I think that the writing is as good as anything I write now, which seems to say something good about my mental state. I would rather be a faulty writer than a faulty person. I haven't really written anything since that was such a flight of fancy; that has been written by the scruff of its neck. When it has taken offline, there was an awkwardness to it, no real ceremony or happening; not that it necessarily deserved it. I know some artists who are happy with their jobs as a digital sand artists; waiting for the next tide to wash their next work away, a mandala-like acceptance, a noblility.

But I am not so noble. The Black Crown Project always wanted to be an archive of itself. It was about stasis, immortality, ruin. It was always in the preterite; it was a preterite thing. The obsession of self-curation, of being remembered. I wrote it like that for a reason. Though I do not have the inclination, time or mental illness to recreate it, to remake it as something less stilted, more addictive, more competent and systemic and litarate, I thought somebody else would.
