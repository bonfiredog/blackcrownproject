*The Black Crown Project* was like pulling something tender from its root, millimetre by millimetre, so I will try to do this as quickly as possible.

*The Black Crown Project* pretended that it had a tensile strength, an artistic torque and deep, permeating foundations, but in reality it was all about shallow breadth, and multitudes next to multitudes. It attempted to hide its many faults in its mat, and to pretend that complication was complexity. I will try to lay everything out here in one dimension, drying in something like the sun. It has taken me over a year to tease it all out.

*The Black Crown Project* would rather be buried, a robust skeleton revealing only its genotype, and not its phenotypic failings. It would rather engineer the carelessness with which we all treated it, and call it a foundation myth. So, I will try to make it promiscuous, to throw it around town; to deliver it to you here lozenged, like one of those capsule graves that owls make. I'm placing it here in a sort of cabinet, like a canopic heart or a kidney stone threaded on a chain. Perhaps the Eremite would like that too.

*The Black Crown Project* was me pacing out a tumour in my soul; marking it with trigs, fingerposts, writing about its unfathomable interior, its dark, far-from-African heart: I was writing as an expert on a place I had never visited. I have visited it since, and it's smaller than I expected. Nowhere near as interesting a place as I made it out to be. The cuisine is bland, the locals harmless, and their taboos mundane. It's brilliantly pedestrian. 

*The Black Crown Project* was all about quarantine, stymy, barrier, regulation, distance and membrane; about holding itself, and myself, together at an apotropaic arm's length; of being terrified of union and loss all at once. I am trying to give it some union, but some things have been lost, and I am sorry. It is nobody's fault, not even my own: after it had finished, it was mulched into unimportance, and we were all looking the other way, when things were lost.

*The Black Crown Project* was an accidental, medieval way to reconfigure a psyche, like a trephination. Nonetheless, I am a very different person now. I used to write like this all the time, for example, even in letters to my godmother, but now I am capable of ocassional lucidity, [as you'll be grateful to find elsewhere](https://github.com/bonfiredog/blackcrownproject/blob/master/INSTRUCTIONS.md). I am happier, and I write less, and probably less well, and at less-auspicious times. It takes me fewer circuits to leave the house, and to love those around me, and to tell them what is wrong. It is very tempting to be irrational, and credit the <i>Project</i> with an exorcist quality, drawing out what made me unhappy like a wen. If I was being less charitable, I would say that it was a Placebo Effect; that writing it all down made me better, and a better person. But it did not. I can view the *Project* with a detachment now, but I spent much of my time buried alive in it, chewing it, washing it down with long walks. It was a sort of nightmare, one of which I am proud, and which had its moments. Its use lay in revealing to me that my life had reached a point in which I could either leave it medically or geographically.

*The Black Crown Project* always wanted to be an archive of itself. It was about stasis, immortality, ruin. It was always in the preterite; it was a preterite thing. The obsession of self-curation, of being remembered. I wrote it like that for a reason. Though I do not have the inclination, time or mental illness to recreate it, to remake it as something less stilted, more addictive, more competent and systemic and litarate, I thought somebody else would.
