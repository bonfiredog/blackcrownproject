## License For Use Of *The Black Crown Project* Archive

This archive is completely free ([both *gratis* and *libre*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gratis_versus_libre)) for **anybody** to **use**. 

* **By 'use'**, I mean download, modification (both of the archive wholly and its contents individually), redistribution (both in part and complete), copy or use in any manner, including setting your own license for your derivative work. You can use this archive as the basis for your own projects, create your own version of the project from the archive, or redistribute just a single element of it; no use is prohibited (or at least policed). 

* **By 'anybody'**, I mean any individual, corporation or organisation without active prejudice.

You are not required to credit myself (Rob Sherman), Random House, Popleaf Games, Failbetter Games or any of the parties involved in the original *Black Crown Project*. However, you can assume that any attribution you do make, publicly, will be met with an unbroadcast yet tectonic gratitude at my end of the Internet. Please feel free to contact me [by email](mailto:rob@bonfiredog.co.uk) to alert me to your derivative work: I would be very interested to see it.

Despite all this, I can offer no endorsement, approval or connection to your distribution, modification or original inspired work; use of this archive presupposes that the result is completely independent of our original work.

Please note that I cannot, for my own sake, help with the redevelopment or re-release of the *Project*, though I offer my blessing for you to do so, and would be happy to discuss your plans and offer advice, if I can, [by email](mailto:rob@bonfiredog.co.uk).
